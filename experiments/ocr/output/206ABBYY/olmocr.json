  "21": "the second (2nd) shift employees performed after the regular second (2nd) shift hours does not entitle them to third (3rd) shift premium for such work.\n\nNight or shift premium compensation provided for herein shall be included in the holiday pay and vacation pay of all employees who are eligible for night or shift premium pay.\n\n8.10 Call-Back\nCall-back time shall be interpreted to mean the time an employee is called back to work for the second (2nd) time within one (1) working day. An employee shall not be considered called back if they are recalled twelve (12) hours or more after the completion of their preceding day's work. Call-back hours are those hours occurring between the actual reporting time and the employee's regularly scheduled starting time. It shall not be considered call-back time if an employee reports within twelve (12) hours due to a promotion or voluntary change of shift. Call-back provisions as outlined in this Article do not apply to employees scheduled to work on Saturdays or Last Normal Working Day Before New Year's. The method of computing call-back pay shall be as follows: Double time (2 times the straight-time hourly rate) shall be paid for all actual call-back hours worked, or four (4) hours, whichever is greater. These call-back hours are to be computed separately and shall be disregarded when computing daily and/or weekly overtime pay as specified in Section 8.1 of this Article.\n\n8.11 Injury on the Job\nWhen an employee sustains a work connected injury which in the opinion of a competent authority is severe enough to cause a loss of time during the day or shift on which such injury occurs, the employee will not incur any loss of wages for the remainder of the normal workday or shift on which the employee is injured. The Company will make whole the employee's wages of eight (8) hours at the straight-time hourly classification rate for such normal workday or shift.\n\nPayment of such wages shall not be construed as an admission of liability on the part of the Company under Workers' Compensation Laws or under any other laws.\n\n8.12 Doctor Visits\nEmployees scheduled by management for any doctor visit related to a workers' compensation injury which requires the employee to leave the bakery during his/her normally scheduled workday shall not lose time during that workday for said visit."
