Anyone\nworking in the night cleanup department with departmental rights elsewhere would continue to be paid at the contract\nrate of pay for their department and would be excluded from this S.75/hour bonus. This bonus will be reviewed\nperiodically by the Company for its effectiveness in reducing turnover rates in the night cleanup department. Should\nthe Company determine the rate increase has not fulfilled its expectations, the Company may terminate this\nagreement upon 30 days advance written notice to the Union. At the time of termination of this agreement, all rates\nfor those entering the night cleanup department will revert to the appropriate contractual pay levels.
