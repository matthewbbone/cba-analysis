Broad Street, 19th floor\nPhiladelphia, PA 19102\n\nDear Mr. Byrne:\n\nThis will confirm our understanding regarding Consultants. Except as modified by this Letter of Understanding, all collective bargaining agreement provisions applicable to Service Representatives will continue to apply to Consultants. The Companies may describe the Consultant title as appropriate to designate the specialized functions of various Consultant jobs (e.g., Consumer Consultant, Credit Consultant, Small Business Consultant).\n\nThe duties of the various specialized Consultant jobs may include any or all of the duties previously assigned to Service Representatives, Collectors and/or Collection Representatives. Achievement of sales results will be a job requirement for the Consultant jobs which specialize in sales, provided that sales results will not be the sole basis for discipline. In determining whether a Consultant's sales results are satisfactory, the reasons for failing to meet sales objectives (such as local economic downturns, product or service failures, etc.) always will be taken into consideration. The introduction of new equipment, new technology and/or support systems to be used by Consultants in the workplace (such as software, personal computers and/or Sale Service Negotiation System (SSNS)) does not constitute a restructuring of the Consultant job or the creation of a new job from existing Consultant job duties.\n\nSubject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions, Consultants will receive such training as the Companies determine from time to time to be appropriate. Not all Consultants will necessarily receive the same type or degree of training; for example, a Consultant may receive specific collection-related training or only sales-and-service training.\n\nThe work performed by Consultants may be transferred between and among the Companies as the Companies deem appropriate, provided that no such transfer will directly result in the layoff, downgrade or part-timing of any Consultant.",
