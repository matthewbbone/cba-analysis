Except as modi-\nfied by this Letter of Understanding, all collective bargaining agreement provi-\nsions applicable lo Service Representatives will continue to apply to Consultants.\nThe Companies may describe the Consultant title as appropriate to designate the\nspecialized functions of various Consultant jobs (e.g.. Consumer Consultant,\nCredit Consultant. Small Business Consultant),\n    The duties of the various specialized Consultant jobs may include any or all\nof the duties previously assigned to Service Representatives, Collectors and/or\nCollection Representatives. Achievement nf sates results will be a job require-\nment for the Consultant jobs which specialise in sales, provided that sales results\nwill not be the sole basis for discipline. In determining whether a Consultant's\nsales results are satisfactory, thre reasons for failingTOmeet salei t*jecii ves (such\nas local economic downturns, product or service failures, etc.) always will be\ntaken into consideration. The introduction of new equipment, new technology\nand/or support sysieros to be used by Consultants in the wotfcplace (such as soft-\nware. personal computers and/or Sale Service Negotiation System (SSNSi) does\nnot constitute arestructuringof the Consultant job or the creation of a new job\nfrom existing Consultant job duties,\n     Subject lo any applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions, Con-\nsultants will receive such training as the Companies determine from lime to time\nto be appropriate. Not all Consultants will necessarily receive the same type or\ndegree of training; for example, a Consultant may receive specific collectiou-\ntelated training or only sules-and-scrvice training.\n    The work performed by Consultants may be transferred between and among\nthe Companies as the Companies deem appropriate, provided that no such trans-\nfer will directly result in the layoff, downgrade or pan-timing of any Consultant,\n\n\n\n\n                                        [21]\n\f",
