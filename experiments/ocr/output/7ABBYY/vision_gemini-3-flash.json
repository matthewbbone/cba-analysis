Broad Street. 19th floor\nPhiladelphia, PA 19102\n\nDear Mr. Byrne:\n\n      This will confirm our understanding regarding Consultants. Except as modi-\nfied by this Letter of Understanding, all collective bargaining agreement provi-\nsions applicable to Service Representatives will continue to apply to Consultants.\nThe Companies may describe the Consultant title as appropriate to designate the\nspecialized functions of various Consultant jobs (e.g., Consumer Consultant,\nCredit Consultant, Small Business Consultant).\n\n      The duties of the various specialized Consultant jobs may include any or all\nof the duties previously assigned to Service Representatives, Collectors and/or\nCollection Representatives. Achievement of sales results will be a job require-\nment for the Consultant jobs which specialize in sales, provided that sales results\nwill not be the sole basis for discipline. In determining whether a Consultant's\nsales results are satisfactory, the reasons for failing to meet sales objectives (such\nas local economic downturns, product or service failures, etc.) always will be\ntaken into consideration. The introduction of new equipment, new technology\nand/or support systems to be used by Consultants in the workplace (such as soft-\nware, personal computers and/or Sale Service Negotiation System (SSNS)) does\nnot constitute a restructuring of the Consultant job or the creation of a new job\nfrom existing Consultant job duties.\n\n      Subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions, Con-\nsultants will receive such training as the Companies determine from time to time\nto be appropriate. Not all Consultants will necessarily receive the same type or\ndegree of training; for example, a Consultant may receive specific collection-\nrelated training or only sales-and-service training.\n\n      The work performed by Consultants may be transferred between and among\nthe Companies as the Companies deem appropriate, provided that no such trans-\nfer will directly result in the layoff, downgrade or part-timing of any Consultant.\n\n[21]",
