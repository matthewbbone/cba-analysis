The MCPS excerpt does not include these sophisticated prefunding mechanisms or a VEBA; it focuses on plan options and premium sharing."",\n""Plan design specificity: Lucent lists concrete POS plan parameters (office copays, coinsurance, in‑/out‑of‑network deductibles and OOP maximums), 4‑tier prescription copay structure, and mental‑health/chemical dependency specifics.
