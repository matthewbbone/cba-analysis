SECTION 3
HOW TO ENROLL
A. Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plans. Employees automatically are 36
enrolled in the Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismembetment Plans when eligible. The 37
employee may designate a beneficiary for life and accident benefits through the Boeing Service Center. 38
B. Medical Plans. In designated locations, the Company provides employees with a choice among 40
medical plans. The Traditional Medical Plan offers enhanced benefirs when a member of irs network 41
is used. Coordinated care plans also rely on selected networks of providers.
Employees receive enrollment instructions at the time of employment and may elect medical coverage 44
under one medical plan by rhe date indicated on the enrollment worksheet. All family members, 45
including the employee, must be enrolled in the same medical plan, except as specified in Section 2.A. 46

plan or the Traditional Medical Plan.
2. Employees who do not live or work in a coordinated care plan service area may enroll in the 53
Traditional Medical Plan.
Some coordinated care plans do not offer same-gender domestic partner coverage.
A-5
3, Each employee with a spouse (or same-gender domestic partner) enrolled in a Company-sponsored
phtn must provide information regarding coverage available through another employer to determine
whether or not special contributions ate required to enroll the spouse. If the employee does
not authorize a required contriburion, the spouse will not be enrolled for medical coverage. The
employee will not be able to enroll the spouse until the earlier of:
a. The next annual enrollment period.
b. The date the spouse loses the option to be coveted under the other employer-sponsored
medical plan.
The Company will require periodic verification of data.
!4 C. Dental Plans. Employees in certain areas are offered three (3) dental plans: the Scheduled Dental
Plan, Preferred Dental Plan, and Prepaid Dental Plan. In certain areas, provider networks for the
Preferred Dental Plan and/or Prepaid Dental Plan may not be available and employees are offered only

Prepaid Dental Plan for employees who live in a service area of the Preferred Dental Plan or
Prepaid Denral Plan.
Under the Prepaid Dental Plan, employees must select a participating provider from the
prepaid provider network. No dental benefits are payable until the employee selects a participating
provider.
2. The Company provides dental coverage under the Scheduled Dental Plan to employees who do
not live or work in a service area of the Preferred Dental Plan or Prepaid Dental Plan,
35 D. Annual Enrollment Period. The Company establishes an annual enrollment period when employees
may change medical and/or dental plans.
38 E. Special Enrollment. If an employee declines dependent enrollment in the medical and dental plans
because of other employer~sponsored health care coverage (such as through a spouse's employer), the
employee may be able to enroll eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored mediai and dental plans
during the year as long as enrollment is within sixty (60) days after other coverage ends.
If an employee declines dependent enrollment when first eligible and the dependent's other health care
coverage was through continuation coverage from a previous employer (coverage mandated by the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA), the dependent must exhaust
his of her COBRA coverage to be eligible for the special enrollment period.
If a dependent's other health care coverage was not through COBRA, the coverage loss must be due
to loss of eligibility for the health care coverage (including from divorce, death, termination of
employment, or reduction in hours of employment) or termination of employer contributions toward
such coverage.
--
13. The employee is transferred to a different division, affecting eligibility for benefirs under 46
Company-sponsored health care plans.
The employee also may change an election to comply with a qualified medical child support otder 49
(QMCSO) to provide or cancel coverage for a child resulting from a divorce, annulment, or change 50
in legal custody.
In most situations, the employee musr request enrollment within sixty (60) days after the qualified 53
event. An employee can entoll a new dependent within one hundred rwenry (120) days following the 54
employee's marriage or entering into a same-gender domestic partner relationship or a dependent 55

same-gender domestic partner relationship, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, the employee
must call the Boeing Service Center and speak with a customer service representative. In all cases, the
employee must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation
within thirty-one (31) days of the date the enrollment is requested or the coverage change request will
be denied.

by calling the Boeing Service Center.

--
d. If a dependent child's parents are divorced or separated and a coutt decree establishes 6
financial responsibility for the health care coverage oi~ the child, the plan of the parent with 7
such financial responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree is silent on

secondary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active 38
employee. Medicate is primary in mosr other circumstances.

will continue during the total disability instead of all other Company life insurance and accidental 29
death and dismembetment benefits.

--

Article 20
ARTICLE 20 - ADJUSTMENTS TO THE WORKING FORCE
1 The Company desires to maintain employment as near to a constant level as possible. Both parties recognize, however, that the needs of the business and its efficient operation may necessitate reassignment of personnel or the addition to, or decrease in the working force.
2 The Company shall give the National or Local involved advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of a Layoff.
3 When lack of work necessitates Layoff, Employees shall be Latd-Off in accordance with Term of Employment and by Layoff groups as set forth in the following:
(a) Employees with less than five (5) years' Term of Employment shall be first Laid-Off in inverse order of Term of Employment, except that 10% of the total number of such Employees as of the time Layoffs start may be exempt from the Layoff and retained on the roll. The Layoff group shall be the Employees assigned to a Base Location.
(b) Employees retained on the roll under the provisions of Paragraph 3(a) shall be next Laid-Off.
(c) Employees with a Term of Employment of five (5) years but less than eight (8) years shall be next Laid-Off, in inverse order of Term of Employment, except that 10% of the total number of such Employees as of the time Layoffs start may be exempt from the Layoff and retained on the roll.

Such Employee
128
will continue to be a part of the Layoff group set forth in Paragraph 3(a) for purposes of determining ""the total number of such Employees"" to which the 10% exemption applies but will not be considered as having been exempt from Layoff pursuant to such paragraph.
{h) Employees with ten (10) years' or more Term of Employment shall be next Laid-Off, in inverse order of Term of Employment. The Layoff group shall be the Employees assigned to all Base Locations.

7 A former Employee who has been Laid-Off shall be returned to work in the inverse order of Layoff (except as provided in Paragraph 9) at the Base Location from which he or she was Laid-Off provided he or she makes himself or herself locally available to said Base Location, and provided that he or she is qualified for the work to be done, physically fit, and has not been Laid-Off for more than three (3) years.
(a) In a Multiple Computation Point Base Location, the Company may offer recall, in inverse order of Layoff at the Base Location, to a former Employee who has not been Laid Off for more than three (3) years at a Computation Point within the Multiple Computation Point Base Location other than that to which the Employee was assigned at the time of Layoff. If this occurs, and the Employee refuses to accept such recall, he or she shall continue to retain his or her recall rights until an offer is made to the Computation Point to which the Employee had been

Article 22
settlement or a modification thereof is adopted by the written concurrence of the representatives of each party at the final step of the grievance procedure, as provided in ARTICLE 7, GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE. (6) The time limits in 7(c)(1) and 7(c)(4) of this Paragraph may be extended by agreement of the parties or at the umpire's request, in either case only in emergency situations. Such extensions shall not circumvent the purpose of this expedited procedure. (7) In any grievance arbitrated under the provisions of this Paragraph 7, the Company shall under no circumstances be liable for back pay for more than twelve (12) months (plus any time that the processing of the grievance or arbitration was delayed at the specific request of the Company) after the date of the disciplinary action.

4 Employees who are on vacation or absent with pay on their paid Excused Work Day for reasons other than having observed it as an Excused Work Day shall have their paid Excused Work Day rescheduled if a vacation day would have been rescheduled under the same circumstances.

(a) Employees who agree to work before the work schedule becomes fixed shall receive one (1) day's pay as set forth in Paragraph 2 in lieu of their Excused Work Day and shall in addition be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering work on a scheduled day of work.

(a) An Employee may designate and schedule, as applicable, four (4) EWD (s) to be used flexibly. This provision shall apply to an Employee's unpaid EWD and/or his/her paid EWD(s) which are not designated by the Company.
140
Article 25 (b) Each flexible EWD may be divided into increments of two (2) hours for an
increment, provided, however, that where the length of an Employee's scheduled daily tour is not evenly divisible by two (2), the last increment of each EWD may be less than two (2) hours. (c) An increment may be taken at any time during the vacation schedule period up to and including the actual scheduled Excused Work Day provided his/her supervisor is notified before the beginning of the tour and not more than twenty five percent (25%) of the work group has already been granted time off. In the event more than twenty five percent (25%) of the work group is scheduled off, then the time may be granted consistent with the needs of the business. (d) The time may be taken based on the Employee's personal need to take the time. (e) If there is unused time available on the day of the so-scheduled EWD, the Employee must take the remaining time on the scheduled day even if that increment is less than two (2) hours.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND ALARM CONTROL (ESAC) CENTER MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This will confirm our understanding of May 28, 1995 regarding the Phoenix, Arizona Electronic Surveillance and Alarm Control (ESAC) Center and future ESAC centers.
Installation Bargaining Unit Employees will be responsible for but not limited to:
--
--
> decisions regarding further escalation of troubles and the interface with higher levels of technical support such as RTAC, Bell Labs, etc., and,

This Memorandum of Understanding will confirm our May 28, 1995 agreement regarding the establishment of Maintenance Points of Presence (MPOP's) to facilitate the provision of maintenance services outside of the existing Base Locations listed in CWA-21.
I Definition Article 13 of CWA-21 is amended to add the following definition:
""Maintenance Point of Presence"" <MPOP): A location designated by the Company which is more than 50 miles from an existing Base Location and where there is a maintenance service opportunity requiring a dedicated onsite technician.
II Staffing . The filling of any maintenance service assignment at an MPOP designated by the Company will be according to the following process:
1 The establishment of an MPOP, as well as the determination and evaluation of the job skills, knowledge, training, and experience required for the maintenance service work functions to be performed at the MPOP, will be made solely by the Company. The Union will be given notification of the establishment of an MPOP prior to its effective date.
2 An MPOP assignment will be circulated and/or posted at the work locations within the geographic territory of the Company's Customer Team having the MPOP opening. The job information will include the job skills, knowledge, training, and experience requirements for the opening, including the minimum skills which would be considered in the event that no employee can meet all of the requirements for the position(s). The Local Union will be given copies of the MPOP job assignment and requirements.
3 Employees who wish to be considered for the MPOP job assignment(s) may volunteer for a Permanent Transfer to the applicable MPOP location.
4 The Company will evaluate the job skills, knowledge, training, and experience of volunteer candidates for the MPOP job assignment(s). The selection from volunteer candidates who are qualified for the MPOP assignment(s) shall proceed according to the following priority:
205
(a) Employees who reside within 50 miles of the MPOP computation point;
(b) Employees assigned to the Base Location nearest to the MPOP;
(c) Employees assigned to Base Locations within the same State, Area (as defined in a Memorandum of Understanding dated May 31, 1992 and printed on pages 149-153 of CWA-20), or Region, in that order, as the MPOP;
(d) Employees assigned to any Base Location nationwide provided the employee(s) can be released from their present assignment.
(e) Subject to the foregoing criteria, when the qualifications of two or more volunteer candidates are substantially equal and meet the minimum requirements for the position(s), the selection will be according to the seniority of the volunteer candidates.
5 In the event that there are no qualified volunteer candidates who meet both the minimum job qualifications for the MPOP position(s) and the geographic priority established by Paragraph A (a) through (c), above, the Company may elect to waive certain of the qualification requirements for the position(s) before seeking to staff the position(s) pursuant to Paragraph 4 (d), above. If, after this election, two (2) or more volunteer candidates possess substantially the same qualifications for the position(s), as determined solely by the Company, the selection(s) will be made according to the seniority of the volunteer candidates.
6 In the event that the Company determines that there are no volunteer candidates who are qualified for the MPOP position(s), the permanent transfer of employees having the necessary job skills, knowledge, training, or experience may be implemented pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties regarding the Permanent Transfers to destinations requiring specific skill categories (Memorandum of Understanding-Permanent Transfers For Skills of CWA-21). It is understood that the requirement, contained in the Memorandum of Understanding referenced immediately above, to layoff employees (in the same Area or in the affected Base Location, as the case may be) as a prerequisite to invoking Permanent Transfers for Skill reasons shall not apply to Skill Permanent Transfers to an MPOP.
7 In the event that an MPOP position cannot be filled through the procedures set forth in Paragraphs 3 through 6, inclusive, the position(s) will be advertised in ATS. If the ATS process produces no candidate with the minimum qualifications for the position, as solely determined by the
206
Company, outside candidates may be hired from the geographic area in which the MPOP is located.
6 If a qualified employee is identified and selected for an MPOP position pursuant to Paragraphs 3 through 6, inclusive, the selected employee(s) will be permanently transferred to the MPOP and will receive Permanent Transfer expense treatment in accordance with contract provisions in effect at the time of the transfer.
9 The work site will become the MPOP Computation Point. Daily Miscellaneous Allowance will be provided per Article 13, Paragraph 3(a), zero (0) to five (5) miles.
10 The selected employee will maintain the wage schedule from his/her originating Base Location per Article 12, Paragraph 4(b)(2) through 4(b)(2)(iv) At the expiration of the time periods set forth in Paragraphs 4(b)(2)/4(b){2)(iv), employees assigned to an MPOP location will assume the wage schedule of the closest Base Location within 100 miles of the MPOP. If there is no Base Location within 100 miles of the MPOP, it will be assigned Wage Schedule 2.
11 Should the maintenance service requirement at an MPOP be eliminated or reduced, thereby creating a surplus situation at the MPOP, an employee with more than 10 years service will be offered an opportunity to permanently transfer to another MPOP or Base Location and receive Permanent Transfer expense treatment in accordance with the contract provisions which are in effect at the time of the transfer. Should such an employee decline the Permanent Transfer, he/she will receive treatment per Article 13, Paragraph 2(i)(1)(ii). A surplus MPOP employee with less than ten (10) years service may be laid off or permanently transferred to another MPOP or Base Location at the option of the Company in accordance with current contract provisions. Seniority will be the determining factor for Permanent Transfers out of the MPOP. Junior employees will be permanently transferred before senior employees in the same skill category and may be from any one of the following skills:
5ESS 5ESS - M Wireless Wireless - M OSS OSS - M
Data Networking Systems
Data Networking Systems - M
4ESS 4ESS-M
Power Power-M 1AESS 1AESS - M
Transmission Transmission - M Non-AT&T SW Non-AT&T SW - M
12 Force Reduction in a MPOP by layoff will be by the process in Article 20.
207
13 Notwithstanding Paragraphs 11 and 12, the Company agrees that it shall not Permanently Transfer employees from an MPOP to alleviate surplus conditions at a time when there are employees on the Company's active roll within the MPOP who have a Term of Employment of less than four (4) years.

MODE OF OPERATIONS AGREEMENT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This will confirm our understanding of May 31, 1992 concerning the treatment of Employees assigned by the Company to installation work outside of Switching Systems, Toll Carrier and Radio Systems, and associated Power equipment performed in Central Offices. Such assignments would include work such as service and maintenance contracts, Installation Test Center Operations, operation support systems, central office maintenance, and customer premise equipment associated with maintenance and service.
1 The Company and Union agree that the character of the work on such assignments will make it necessary for Employees to move to and from job sites to meet customer service needs and it will generally not be possible to give notice on Local Assignment and Temporary Transfer in accordance with Article 13, Paragraph 2.6. However the Company will give as much notice as possible. It is further recognized that the demand of the customer may also require overtime and needs and conditions may arise which will prevent giving Employees notice as specified in Article 11, Paragraph 1.2.
2 Employees shall be required to wear appropriate attire in keeping with the work environment of the operations being performed. Employees on service and maintenance assignments involving direct contact with the customer may be required to wear a button-up dress shirt with a necktie, dress slacks, and dress shoes. Sport or suit type jackets may be required based on local customary business and climatic conditions. Female Employees on such assignments shall wear comparable suitable dress attire.
3 Company-provided vehicles shall ordinarily be used in the performance of such operations in accordance with provisions of Article 13, Paragraph 2.3. Notwithstanding the limitations on air travel in Article 13 Paragraph 4.12, travel by airplane may be used on temporary transfers of less than 800 road miles where, in the judgment of the Company, time, distance and customer demands so dictate.
4 The Company may require such Employees to carry paging devices during scheduled working time.
5 Employees shall exercise reasonable and responsible care with respect to Company provided vehicle, tools, and equipment.
6 To the extent consistent with business needs, the Company shall assign Employees who, in its judgment, are qualified for the work to be done in accordance with their preference for such assignments, however the Company retains the right to make selections based on its business needs.
209
7 It is agreed that the Seven Day Coverage provisions specified in Contract CWA-20 shall be limited to Employees and job assignments covered by this agreement.
In all other respects, the provisions of Contract CWA-20 will apply to Employees on such assignments.

B.
Retiree Health Benefits Act. The parties agree to present to Congress
and the Administration a proposed amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, (the ""Code"") to be known as the Retiree Health Benefits Act,
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the ""Act""), and to use their best
efforts, working cooperatively, to secure passage of the Act. As a condition to
the Company's commitment to fund healthcare benefits as described in Section E
below, the parties agree that the Act must contain the following provisions:
1. An employer may, from time to time, fund in a section 401(h) account collectively bargained retiree healthcare benefits, not only for current years but also for future years, by in its discretion either transferring to such account excess pension assets, as determined in accordance with section 420 of the Code, or by making supplemental contributions from operating cash as may be required to fund those benefits even if otherwise limited by the full funding limitation.
2. To take advantage of the provisions of the Act, an employer must make an enforceable commitment to fund or prefund retiree healthcare benefits, or set aside excess pension assets to fund or prefund retiree healthcare benefits, as described above, at a level of cost or subsidy negotiated with a union or unions.
3. At the time of a transfer, all pension plan participants would become fully vested in their accrued pension benefit.
4. The employer would not be subject to any maintenance of cost requirement as a result of prefunding, funding or setting aside amounts in accordance with the Act.
5. Transfers of excess pension assets will not be deductible to the employer, but any contributions to the 401(h) account from operating cash will be deductible.
C.
Retiree Healthcare Caps for All Years. Solely for purposes of
determining the amount of the Company's subsidy or cost each year for
postretirement healthcare benefits for Eligible Participants, the Retiree Healthcare Cap shall be calculated as the sum of (a), (b), and (c) below determined for each individual projected to participate in the Retiree Medical Plan and/or the Retiree Dental Plan as of the beginning of such year, where:
""(a)"" is equal to the following amounts, applied to each retiree who retired on or after March 1,1990:
Under age 65 - single coverage: Under age 65 - family coverage: Age 65 and over - single coverage: Age 65 and over - family coverage:
$4,225 $8,600 $2,000 $4,625
""(b)"" is equal to Medicare Part B premiums calculated for those retirees who retired on or after March 1, 1990 in accordance with the following schedule:
Retirement Date
On or after 3/1/90 but prior to 5/31/98 On or after 5/31/98
Retiree premium $46.00/month
$46.00/month
Spouse premium $33.00/month
$0
and ""(c)' is an amount, for enrolled pre-3/1/90 retirees, equal to the expected cost of the 2004 plan design for the year of determination.
The amount of the Company's subsidy each year for postretirement healthcare benefits for Eligible Participants for 2005 and thereafter shall be equal to the Retiree Healthcare Cap.
The parties recognize that the actual costs of the Company in any year may differ from the Retiree Health Care cap for that year, and that the Company may make appropriate adjustments in that year or future years to substantially comply with the Retiree Healthcare Cap provisions.
D.
Healthcare Benefits for 2005 and 2006
(1)
2005 Healthcare Benefits,
Postretirement medical benefits for Eligible Participants under the Retiree Medical Plan and the Retiree Dental Plan will continue from January 1, 2005 until the changes to such plans described in Exhibit B can be implemented. Such implementation date shall be on or before March 1, 2005 as determined by the
270
Company. After such implementation date, such benefits will be provided in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B. The Company will absorb the cost in excess of the Retiree Healthcare Caps for the period commencing October 1, 2004 and ending on such implementation date.
(2)
2006 Healthcare Benefits.
The Company's subsidy for calendar year 2006 towards postretirement medical and dentat benefits under the Retiree Medical Plan and the Retiree Dental Plan for Eligible Participants will be determined in accordance with the Retiree Healthcare Cap provisions. A Joint Retiree Healthcare Committee (the ""Joint Committee"") will be established to determine the plan design and premium costs for 2006, working in conjunction with the Company and the Trustees of the Welfare Benefits Trust (as described in Section G) or their representatives. The Joint Committee shall make its initial findings and recommendation by May 15, 2005, with the deadline of finalizing such plan design and premium costs by June 15,2005. If the Joint Committee is unable to make such a determination by June 15, 2005, the Company shall implement a plan design and premium costs consistent with the Retiree Healthcare Cap provisions of Section C. To the extent plan design reductions are necessary to achieve the Retiree Healthcare Caps, and to the extent legally permissible, they shall be made first to dental benefits, second to Medicare Part B reimbursements, and then to medical benefits.
The Joint Committee shall consist of two representatives appointed by each Union and four representatives appointed by the Company.
E.
Healthcare Benefits and Funding for 2007 and All Later Years.
Application of Section E.
This Section E applies if the Act is enacted into law before September 1, 2006. If the Act is not enacted into law before that date or it is enacted but is not consistent with the requirements of Subsection F(4) below, this Section E shall not apply and Section F shall apply.
Healthcare Benefits for 2007 and Later.
For each calendar year commencing in 2007, the Company's subsidy towards
retiree medical and dental plans for Eligible Participants will be determined in
accordance with the Retiree Healthcare Cap provisions of Section C. The Joint
Committee will determine the plan design and premium costs for each calendar
\
year commencing in 2007, working in conjunction with the Company and the
271
Trustees of the Welfare Benefits Trust or their representatives. For each calendar year commencing in 2007, the Joint Committee shall make its initial findings and recommendation by May 15 of the prior year, with the deadline of finalizing such plan design and premium costs by June 15 of the prior year. If the Joint Committee is unable to make such a determination by June 15 of the prior year, the Company shall implement a plan design and premium costs consistent with the Retiree Healthcare Cap provisions of Section C. To the extent plan design reductions are necessary to achieve the Retiree Healthcare Caps, and to the extent legally permissible, they shall be made first to dental benefits, second to Medicare Part B reimbursements, and then to medical benefits.
(3)
Company Healthcare Fundino for 2007 and Later,
The Company agrees that it shall cause the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for Company-provided postretirement medical and dental plans for Eligible Participants, as determined by the Company in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard 106, to be funded commencing in 2007 by contributions to a section 401(h) account in the Lucent Technologies Pension Plan (""LTPP"") in accordance with the Act. Such contributions shall be made either from transfers of pension assets in excess of 125% of plan liabilities (as determined under the Act) or from Company contributions, in either case as contemplated by the Act. The Company shall determine, in its sole discretion, for each year whether it shall fund such amount from Company contributions or from excess pension assets. The Company shall make the initial funding of the section 401(h) account in 2007 from excess pension assets or Company contributions in an amount at least sufficient (after considering available VEBA trust assets) to pay annual costs for retiree healthcare under this Section for that year. The Company shall continue to fund the 401(h) account on the same basis for each year thereafter until it determines there are sufficient assets in the pension plan to fully fund the remaining FAS 106 liabilities for that year in accordance with the Act, in which event the Company may transfer excess pension assets to fully fund the remaining FAS 106 liabilities. At such time, should the Company choose not to fully fund the remaining FAS 106 liabilities, its commitment to continue to fund on an annual basis, either from excess pension assets or Company contributions, shall continue.
In years after such full funding transfer, the section 401(h) account shall be fully funded on an annual basis from excess pension assets or Company contributions as the FAS 106 liabilities are recalculated as a result of experience or changed assumptions.
272
For purposes of determining such accumulated postretiremen! benefit obligation for each year, the plans described in this Section shall be used and the actuarial methods and assumptions shall be the same as those used by the Company in the presentation of its financial statements under FAS 106 for the applicable fiscal year. Excluding Medicare Part D reimbursements, the cost impact of any government program that takes effect on or after November 1, 2004 that results in a reduction of costs shall be allocated between the Company and the retirees in an equitable manner. The cost of any benefit provided by another employer (such as through coordination of benefits) shall reduce the Company's obligation under this Section.
For purposes of determining the Company's funding levels under FAS 106 for Eligible Participants, the Retiree Medical Cap provisions of Section C shall apply.
F.
Other Provisions.
Upon the expiration of the 2003 CWA/ISEW/Lucent National
Memorandum of Understanding (""2003 MOU""), the agreement in that MOU
extending application of the retiree medical caps past the expiration of the 2003
MOU has been terminated and its obligations are no longer binding upon the
Company or the Unions. The parties agree that this 2004 Memorandum of
Understanding agreement on postretirement medical and dental benefits fully
supersedes and replaces all prior oral or written agreements among the parties
with respect to postretirement medical and dental benefits.
Upon the expiration of the 2003 MOU, the January 9, 2003 letter
agreement titled ""VEBA Stock Proposal"", printed as part of the 2003 MOU, has
been terminated and its obligations are no longer binding upon the Company or
the Unions. The January 9, 2003 letter provided a funding mechanism for the
VEBA trust for the years 2005 and thereafter, providing that certain conditions
had been met. This agreement extinguishes application of the January 9, 2003
letter to any period after the expiration of the 2003 MOU.
The May 31,1998 letter agreement. Attachment 6 of the 2003 MOU, is
hereby cancelled and has no further force and effect. The May 31, 1998 letter
committed Lucent to ""negotiate the level of health care caps and company
contributions for retiree medical coverage and vehicles for providing such
contributions for those who retired after March 1. 1990 in all future bargaining
sessions with the two unions."" This agreement extinguishes application of the
May 31, 1998 letter to any period after the expiration of the 2003 MOU.
(4)
If the Retiree Health Benefits Act is not enacted into law by September
1, 2006, or if such Act is enacted but does not meet each of the basic
273
requirements described in Subsection B above or, in the Company's sole discretion, imposes additional constraints that significantly impair the Company's ability to prefund retiree healthcare benefits in accordance with such Act as currently contemplated, Sections A through E of this agreement on Postretirement Medical and Dental Benefits shall terminate on such date, there shall be no further obligation to fund the Welfare Benefits Trust under Subsection G(3), and this Section F shall survive. No prior agreement reached among the parties or prior obligation of any party terminated by this Memorandum of Understanding shall be revived upon such termination. The parties understand that under such circumstances, the Company may exercise its discretion regarding the amount of a retiree healthcare subsidy on or after December 31, 2006. Under such circumstances, the parties may, consistent with their understanding of the permissive nature of the subject, but shall not be obligated to, enter into discussions with respect to retiree healthcare, but in no event shall any retiree healthcare subsidy the Company may provide exceed the Retiree Healthcare Cap funding level described in Section C above.
(5)
The parties may agree at any time to discuss plan design changes that
may reduce the premium costs or .may otherwise benefit plan participants,
including but not limited to changes that may be appropriate in light of significant
changes to the United States healthcare system. However, nothing herein shall
require the Company or the Union to bargain over postretirement medical and
dental benefits, which the parties acknowledge is a permissive subject of
bargaining.
G.
Welfare Benefits Trust
Establishment of Welfare Benefits Trust. The parties recognize that
the actual cost of the postretirement healthcare benefits to be made available to
Eligible Participants through the Retiree Medical Plan and the Retiree Dental
Plan exceeds the level established by the Retiree Healthcare Caps and that the
excess cost would, in the absence of further funding, have to be met by premium
(or other) payments by Eligible Participants. The parties further recognize that
the additional costs that the Eligible Participants would have to absorb may make
further participation in the retiree healthcare program prohibitive for many.
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish a supplemental retiree healthcare benefit bust to pay a portion of the cost of healthcare benefits that the Eligible Participants (who may, for purposes of this Section G, include active employees who have retired from the Company) would otherwise be required to absorb through premiums or other payments. Such trust shall be a joint labor management employee benefit fund to be known as the Lucent Welfare Benefits
274
Trust (the Trust"")- The obligations set forth in this Section G are in addition to any obligations set forth elsewhere in this Memorandum.
The Trust will be established by February 28, 2005. The Trust will be a voluntary employees' beneficiary association meeting the requirements of section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and will meet other applicable legal requirements, including Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (""ERISA""). All assets of the Trust shall be held for the exclusive purposes of (i) providing retiree healthcare benefits to Eligible Participants and their beneficiaries, and (ii) defraying the reasonable expenses of administering the Trust. The Trust may provide benefits to participants and beneficiaries by reimbursing the Company for benefit payments previously made under the Retiree Medical Plan or Retiree Dental Plan. Although contributions are provided until fiscal year 2012, the parties anticipate that the Trust may continue to operate beyond that date.
Trustees. The Trustees of the Trust shall be one individual appointed
by each Union, and two individuals appointed by the Company, or their
respective successors. The Trustees will have the exclusive authority to manage
the Trust fund and invest its assets for the exclusive benefit of its participants
consistent with the requirements of ERISA. The Trustees shall meet at least
quarterly or on a different schedule as they may determine.
Funding. The Trust will be funded by contributions by the Company or,
if permitted by applicable law, may in the Company's discretion be funded by
asset transfers from the LTPP. The Company will fund the Trust, or cause it to
be funded, with assets of $400 million. Such funding shall be completed by the
end of fiscal year 2012. The Company shall determine the exact amount of each
annual contribution and when such contributions shall be made; provided,
however, that a minimum payment shall be made for each year of this agreement
in the amount of $25 million. The parties recognize that there is no obligation of
the Company to fund the Trust in excess of the amount set forth in this
paragraph. In addition, the Trust may be funded by contributions or premiums
from Eligible Participants.
Benefits. The Trustees will have the exclusive authority to determine
the amount, manner and timing of benefit payments under the Trust. The
Trustees shall appoint a Benefits Committee, which shall consist of two
representatives nominated by each Union and four representatives nominated by
the Company. A Trustee may serve on the Benefits Committee. The Benefits
275
Committee shall represent the Trustees in carrying out the duties described in Subsections D{2) and E(2).
In conjunction with the establishment of the plan design and premiums as described in Subsections D(2) and E(2), the Trustees will detemiine what amount of benefits are appropriate to be paid from the Trust during the forthcoming year for Eligible Participants taking into consideration the amount of funds available and the need for those funds to provide benefits in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
No representations are made as to the taxability of any benefit provided under the Trust to any Eligible Participant.
Administration, The parties will cooperate in developing guidelines
governing the operations of the Trust, including but not limited to the function of
the Trustees and the Benefits Committee and benefits to be funded by the Trust.
The parties agree that the Trust shall be subject to periodic audit by a qualified
independent accounting firm. The expenses of such audits and other reasonable
expenses of administering the Trust shall be charged to the Trust.

Other Covered Charges Buy Up Provision
Currently, retirees who are Medicare eligible or who are enrolled in the traditional indemnity medical plan have the opportunity to increase the $50,000 maximum amount of company provided coverage for Other Covered Charges (OCC). The OCC buy up allows a retiree to elect an additional $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 of coverage for himself/herself and each covered dependent. The cost per covered individual is $9.00, $18.00, or $27.00 annually. Election of this additional coverage has been required at the time of retirement
The OCC buy up option will now be permitted to be exercised one time at retirement, during the annual open enrollment period or when a qualified status change occurs. Once a retiree has elected the OCC buy up, he/she can only decrease coverage thereafter. Decreases in coverage become effective the first day of the plan year following the plan year in which the election to cancel or decrease was made. No subsequent increases are permitted.
Premiums for Post 3/1/90 Retirees
1 Pre-65 retirees will be as follows: (a) 2005 plan year will be 3% of monthly pension benefit for single (b) 2005 plan year will be 5% of monthly pension benefit for family

Savings Plan benefits for represented participants under the Lucent Technologies Inc. Long Term Savings and Security Plan (the ""Savings Plan"") will continue with such changes described below effective as of January 1, 2005 or as soon thereafter as practicable:
Eligibility
Change eligibility to immediate eligibility to contribute, with Company match commencing after Six Months of Eligibility Service.
Residential Loan Feature
Include a feature that allows for residential loans with up to 175 months to repay.
Limited Double Payroll Deductions
Modify Section 4.5 of the Savings Plan so that all references to 3 months are changed to 4 months, thereby permitting makeup contributions to be made with respect to up the 4 months of missed contributions as long as all such makeup contributions are completed within 4 months of eligibility.
Percent-based Plan Design
Amend the plan to change the participant contribution structure from one based on $5 increments to a percentage-based structure. The employer match would remain at 66-2/3% of the amount of the Pretax Matched Contributions and AfterTax Matched Contributions, which would be limited in the aggregate to 6% of eligible compensation per pay period.
To maximize the company matching contribution for a participant who has attained age 50, no catch-up contribution may be made unless the participant is already contributing at 6% of eligible compensation.
For a Participant with excused unpaid time off for union business during a pay period, Compensation shall include the amount he or she would have been paid by the company based on the adjusted rate of pay that would have applied if the Participant had worked the period of the excused unpaid time off for union business; provided that such rule shall not apply if total deductions for all contributions to the Savings Plan and other deduction and withholding obligations
would be greater than the Participant's actual pay from the Company for such pay period.
Raise Participant Deferral Rate
Participants are eligible to contribute from 1% to 25% of their eligible compensation, In 1% increments, each pay period, subject to IRS limitations then in effect.
Partial Withdrawals by Terminated Participants
Retirees who are eligible for a service pension or disability pension currently have the option to take partial withdrawals from their vested account, in dollar amounts they specify (with a minimum of $300 or the amount in their account, if less). This distribution option would be extended to terminated participants who are not service or disability pension eligible, subject to administrative limits on frequency and minimum amount.
DeMinimls Distributions
If the vested account balance of a participant who separates from service for any reason other than death is $5,000 or less, and such participant does not make a distribution election after the participant's off roll date, the participant's vested account balance will automatically be distributed in a lump sum in accordance with regulatory requirements. Accounts will be valued periodically for this purpose.
Financial Advice Participants will be provided an opportunity to access individual web-based investment advice addressing their investments in the Savings Plan if the advice product is determined advisable by the plan's fiduciaries. Such advice wilt be provided, if at all, under terms agreed upon by the plan's fiduciaries, and on the same basis, including cost structure, as is provided to participants in the Lucent Savings Plan.

National Memorandum FINANCIAL COUNSELING SERVICES
November 1,2004 Mr. Ralph V. Maly, Jr.. Vice President, CWA Mr. Troy A.

THE ALLIANCE FOR EMPLOYEE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
1 Lucent Technologies and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) mutually acknowledge their pride in the talents, abilities, creativity and commitment of Lucent's work force. The parties share a vision of the work environment in which all employees are encouraged to develop their skills, abilities and talents to the fullest extent possible and are furnished every opportunity to take the initiative to do so. Such an environment will not only offer the maximum opportunity to employees to attain their employment goals, but will also lead to increased commitment by employees to devote their maximum energies to improving Lucent's productivity and competitiveness. It is anticipated that this level of employee commitment will contribute significantly to marketplace success for Lucent and to the increased employment security for employees associated with such success.
(a) To help achieve this vision, a separate and distinct jointly administered entity, known as the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development (the Alliance), will continue to operate as a not-for-profit corporation. The mission of the Alliance is to make available learning experiences to employees which will enhance their occupational and work group skills; provide opportunities for personal and career development; stimulate and sustain their contributions to Lucent's success through improved communication skills, motivation, improved work habits and enhanced interpersonal skills; familiarize them with state-of-the-art technology, based on the present or anticipated needs of the business; and increase the probability that it they face displacement or dislocation, they will find alternative employment, either in Lucent or in the outside job market.
(b) The Alliance focuses on both Personal/Career Development and Job Displacement Training curricula. It is envisioned that the Alliance will generally arrange and/or underwrite these curricula by contracting with accredited outside parties for delivery. In some cases, it may provide the curricula directly.
(c) It is understood that the Alliance is not intended to replace Lucent's existing job-specific training, nor does it limit the right of the parties to
305
provide educational and training programs on the same, similar or other subjects as they may deem appropriate.
(d) The Grievance and Arbitration procedures of this Agreement have no application to, or jurisdiction over, any matter relating to the Alliance.
Personal/Career Development Curriculum
2 The types of programs which the Alliance will underwrite to enhance the personal/career development of regular employees will include, but not be limited to:
(a) career counseling
(b) skills inventory and aptitude assessment
(c) career training
(d) personal growth training
(e) training associated with skill development programs, such as QWL, which may not be directly related to the performance of an employee's current job.
Job Displacement Curriculum
3 Lucent will seek to identify those types of occupational jobs in each of Lucent's major organizational units in which growth, as well as decline, are anticipated. From that information and other resources, the Alliance will recommend, arrange and/or underwrite training that will assist those employees who occupy jobs in which a decline is anticipated, or who may be displaced due to force surplus, to acquire new skills. The training will be designed to increase the probability that these employees will be in a position to compete successfully for new positions within Lucent, or to find alternative employment outside of Lucent.
(a) Where appropriate, successful completion of Personal/Career Development or Job Displacement curricula which are relevant to a job will be considered by Lucent when selecting employees for job opportunities.
Curricula Development Implementation and Delivery
306
4 In identifying areas on which Alliance activities should focus, the Alliance will consult with Lucent and CWA officials, as well as with professionals in such fields as higher education, industrial psychology and vocational training. In addition, the Alliance will confer with, advise and offer professional and financial assistance to local training/retraining committees, in such areas as:
(a) identifying educational, training and retraining needs, as well as the resources available to meet those needs
(b) developing programs designed to meet identified employee needs
(c) publicizing and encouraging employee participation in Alliance activities
(d) undertaking to review, evaluate, and make recommendations on proposals for the use of Alliance funds by the local training/retraining committees
(e) coordinating forums, seminars, and workshops for the exchange of ideas and concepts among the local committees
(f) commissioning research into, and evaluation of, alternative approaches to training, retraining, and job placement.
(g) The Alliance will also contact appropriate governmental agencies federal, state and local - to obtain other types of governmental assistance that may be available for Alliance activities.
Eligibility for Participation In Alliance Programs
5 Regular full and part time employees will be eligible to participate in all Alliance activities, in addition, employees who have been displaced or who are on LAYOFF will be eligible to participate in Alliance activities provided that they commence such participation within six months of LAYOFF. A LAID OFF employee may continue participation in Alliance activities for a period extending one year beyond the number of weeks' Termination Allowance the employee is entitled to receive in accordance with the Termination Allowance Article of the applicable local agreement, or until they find alternative employment, whichever occurs first. The Alliance will continue to underwrite any activity that a participant commences within that period, provided that the Alliance initially committed to underwrite it.
307
National Memorandum (a) Participation in either the Personal/Career Development or the Job Displacement curricula is voluntary and will be made available at convenient times and locations, such as after hours at the work site, local community colleges, or CWA offices. Time spent by participants in Alliance activities will be outside scheduled working hours, and not paid or considered as time worked. In selected instances, Lucent, at its discretion, may permit active employees to receive such training during working hours.
Reports 6 The Alliance will publish an Annual Report, detailing the training that was
made available to Lucent employees, the number of participants who received such training, the funds expended and the manner in which funds were utilized.
308
FAMILY CARE DEVELOPMENT FUND (FCDF) The Family Care Development Fund will be suspended for the term of the MOU.
The remaining fund balance ($263,512) will be added to the funding for Alliance and ETOP on a proportional basis, based on October 31, 2004 CWA and IBEW headcount, respectively.
This transfer of funds will be made within 90 day of the date of signing this MOU.
Funding will be continued for grants that were approved by the Family Care Development Fund Joint Committee on or before October 16,2004.

(a) It is recognized that certain services provided in the Center are provided for at the location by the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development (Alliance), the Enhanced Training Opportunities Program (ETOP) or Lucent Technologies, it is not intended that such services be duplicated but rather that the Center will centralize and focus the services to facilitate access by employees.
(b) Employees interested in visiting the Employee Resource Center will. upon request, normally be granted reasonable time off with pay during their SCHEDULED DAILY TOUR to visit the Center. However the parties recognize that the job situation may require that such requests be accommodated at a time other than when initially requested.
(c) In recognition of the parties' shared commitment to the joint administration of the Employee Resource Center, such Center will be referred to as the ""Lucent Technologies/ (""CWA"", ""IBEW SC EM-3"" or ""IBEW SC T-3"") Employee Resource Center. This title shall be used in all references to this operation at the location and shall be prominently displayed at the entrance to the Employee Resource Center facility.
Staffing
Each Employee Resource Center will continue to be staffed by a mutually agreed upon number of COMPANY and UNION appointees. The appointment of Employee Resource Center personnel is a joint responsibility of the local Labor-Management Oversight Committee; however both the COMPANY and the UNION are free to select their own representatives.
(a) Represented employees appointed to work in the Center will retain the Occupational Job Classification and wages they were receiving immediately prior to that assignment.
(1) If such an employee subsequently accepts a promotion to another Occupational Job Classification within the bargaining unit, he or she may be retained on the Employee Resource Center assignment. In such case, the employee will be assigned the Occupational Job Classification and wages which would have been applicable on the Occupational Job Classification to which promoted.
382
(2) For movement of personnel purposes, such employees shall be exempt from displacement by surplus employees outside the Employee Resource Center but shall be subject to LAYOFF in accordance with the contract as a result of a lack of work situation in the bargaining unit.
(3) In those instances where the employee would otherwise have been displaced, he or she shall be assigned the Occupational Job Classification and wages which would have been applicable as a result of such displacement.
Structure
The National Employee Resource Center Steering Committee established by Lucent Technologies and the Unions will continue to include two representatives each from the IBEW SC EM-3 and the CWA, and four Lucent Technologies representatives. The members of this Committee shall be appointed by the Chairpersons of the National Manufacturing Bargaining Committees for the CWA, IBEW SC EM-3 and Lucent Technologies. One additional representative from CWA Operations and IBEW SC T-3 will be appointed by their respective chairs.
(a) The Joint National Steering Committee will continue to be responsible for the implementation, coordination and review of Employee Resource Center activities in Manufacturing, Operations, Repair and Distribution, Installation, OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville. The Committee's specific responsibilities will include:
determining at which locations an Employee Resource Center will be implemented;
establishing the timetable for implementation at designated locations;
determining the staffing level requirements for each Employee Resource Center; except those supporting repair and distribution and material distribution center locations which shall be determined by the National Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee established in paragraph 4(b),
managing available funds including authorizing the distribution of such funds to cover applicable costs at locations with Employee Resource Centers;
overseeing the services and activities provided by the individual Employee Resource Centers.
383
(b) At each location having an Employee Resource Center, a local Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee comprised of an equal number of COMPANY and UNION members will be established. For repair and distribution and material distribution center locations, a National Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee comprised of one CWA and one IBEW System Council T-3 and two Lucent Technologies members shall be established. These committees will coordinate Alliance and ETOP activities at the local/national level and be responsible for the implementation, staffing and administration of the local Employee Resource Center.
Funding the Employee Resource Center
5 The cost of constructing an Employee Resource Center and all ongoing tenant expenses shall continue to be the responsibility of the COMPANY.
(a) The COMPANY will be responsible for the pay and related expenses of those management designated employees who are assigned to work in the Employee Resource Center.
(b) For the period May 31, 1998 through May 31, 2003, inclusive, Lucent Technologies and the Unions agree funds will be made available each month for the Employee Resource Center Program which shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of regular full time IBEW SC EM-3, IBEW SC T-3, and CWA Operations/Manufacturing represented employees on the payroll of the applicable facilities/organizations as of December 31, 1997 by $3.00 for all organizations except Installation, OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville where the applicable rate shall be $1.50. Annually thereafter, the National Employee Resource Center Steering Committee will review the funding level to determine if an increase in funding is warranted to ensure the efficient operation of the ERC's. If so determined, the funding level in subsequent years will be increased back to the original 1992 level of $3.50. However, the rate for Installation, OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville shall remain at $1.50. Lucent Technologies shall credit these funds to an account designated for the Program and its activities within fifteen (15) days of the end of each such month.
(c) Each location which has an Employee Resource Center will be periodically reimbursed from this account for the wages and expenses incurred by the represented employees assigned to work in the Employee Resource Center.
384
National Memorandum (d) At the end of calendar years 1998.1999,2000.2001 and 2002 funding
balances in the Program's account which were accrued during any of those years will be carried forward into the ensuing year's account. (e) If, at the expiration of the 1998 Manufacturing and National Units National Memorandum of Understanding, the parties should not agree to continue the Employee Resource Center Program, all outstanding claims to monies on the books of the Program shall be settled and any remaining monies shall be disposed of in such a manner consistent with the purposes of the Program. Reports 6 The Joint National Steering Committee will publish an Annual Report summarizing the status of Employee Resource Centers, the funds expended and the manner in which the funds were utilized.

Attachment 17
1998 National Memorandum of Understanding WORKPLACE OF THE FUTURE
Lucent, CWA and IBEW reaffirm their commitment to the basic goals and principles of Workplace of the Future (WPOF) as expressed in past contracts. The parties also recognize that WPOF at Lucent needs to be revitalized in order to achieve its goals. All parties see the need for significant culture change at all levels of their respective organizations in order to achieve greater responsiveness and involvement, and for shared involvement of the Unions and management from the beginning of this change process. They therefore agree on the need to jointly re-examine and renew the approach for WPOF in order to move it to a new level.
This re-examination wilt be pursued separately from the 1998 collective bargaining process. It will begin within six weeks of the ratification of all contracts with a thorough re-evaluation of the process and program structure so far and a joint commitment to future courses of action.
With respect to 1998 bargaining, the parties agree to continue existing language of the Workplace of the Future provisions contained in the 1995 National Memorandum of Understanding between the CWA, IBEW and AT&T. The parties reserve their right to redraft language to reflect their renewed commitment and agreement. The parties will redraft language to reflect their renewed commitment and agreement by the end of 1998.

1998 National Memorandum of Understanding EXTENSION OF CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP TRIALS
Mr. R. V. Maly, Assistant to the Vice President, CWA Mr. F. P. Possinger, President, System Council EM-3, IBEW Mr. R. F. Morrison, Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Gentlemen:1
--
The parties also recognize the Unions' goal of growing membership. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to all wholly owned Lucent Business Operating Groups and Divisions throughout the country and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize non-management employees in the covered Lucent Business Operating Groups or Divisions.
1 Employee Choice
Both the Unions and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a Union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a Union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management and local Union officials, i.e., those directly impacted by these discussions. The local Union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate Union and Company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
388
2 Neutrality The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by Company conduct that neither helps nor hinders organizing efforts. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. The environment is intended to foster employee choice and information communicated by either party should be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following: (a) Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
(b) Management will not advocate that employees should vote against Union representation.
(c) The Union(s) will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to communicate with employees.
(d) Management may respond to individual employee questions, and may correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e) The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a ""third party"" or ""outsider"".
(f) Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be simultaneously shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g) Neither party will hire or seek the assistance of consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
<h) Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked, by name or by descriptive reference, in campaign literature or discussions.
(i) Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j) The Company will not conduct ""captive"" audience meetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3 Election Procedures
389
The procedures to be followed are listed betow:
(a) The Union must show that a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining have signed show of interest cards indicating their desire for a representation election. The cards must be dated within three months of the date they are presented to the Third Party Neutral (TPN). Cards signed by persons who are no longer employed by Lucent at the time of submission to the TPN will not be valid.
(b) If an election is conducted and the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months. During this time, no Union organizing campaign for that unit will be permitted.
(c) A majority of those who vote, validated by the TPN, will determine the outcome.
(d) The TPN wilt resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots by following the NLRB's rules and decisions.
4 Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will ""start the dock"". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90 day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed 120 days. If the employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local union from having contact with the workers in the group outside of the workplace. If the employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and any resulting collective bargaining agreement will apply only to the agreed upon unit,
390
5 Informed Decision Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management's rale during this process will include:
(a) responding to individual employee inquiries
(b) explaining the organizing process, including any obligations and responsibilities of the parties
(c) correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or any employee misunderstandings of information disseminated during the campaign process.
6 Free from Coercion Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other persons or entities during any part of this process. One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election. In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process called ""Consent Election"". This process will work as follows:
(a) The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a third party neutral (TPN) proof of support by means of show of interest cards as described in Paragraph 3(a), above. The TPN will then notify Lucent and request a list of names, job titles and work addresses. The Company will furnish the list within three business days. The applicable Union will also be furnished with the list. The ""show of interest"" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union(s) has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(b) The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role it is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two (2) weeks of the submission of the Union's show
391
of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a secret ballot election. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with Paragraph 3(c) of this agreement, a majority of those who vote will control. Each party may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(c) tn all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases in which there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of the TPN and/or of using a neutral site will be shared equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit, the TPN shall either decide the issue within an additional seven days or order an election as described above with the decision as to the composition of the unit to follow the election within no more than seven days.
7 Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union(s) for access, local management and Union representatives will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by Union representatives. The Union(s) will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Lucent facilities. It is the intent and commitment of the parties that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Lucent generally and, specifically, the unit which is the subject of the organizing campaign. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times.
If Lucent and the Union(s) are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other Lucent units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Lucent and the Union(s) commit that they will negotiate an access agreement in an expeditious manner.
8 Dispute Resolution
(a) Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in
392
particular, local Lucent management and appropriate Union representatives. It is the intent and desire of Lucent and the Union(s) that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b) The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. The TPN must be an active or retired attorney who has experience in, and is familiar with, NLRB procedures and precedents regarding unit determination issues. Either Lucent or the Union(s) can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three business days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
(c) If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN wilt attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
393
(d) If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and an expeditious hearing shall be conducted. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
<e) Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Lucent and the Unions believe that these matters are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Lucent and the Union(s) agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(0 The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g) All expenses resulting from the use of the TPN process shall be shared equally by Lucent and the Union.
9 Acquisitions And Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications equipment industry. Lucent may acquire another entity, it has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in these entities may be unrepresented, represented in whole or in part by the CWA or IBEW, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
National Memorandum Nevertheless, Lucent will, after an initial transition period of one year following the dosing on an acquisition, and subject to any contrary legal or contractual requirements, apply this Neutrality and Consent Election agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary. 10 Annual Review On an annual basis, the Lucent Vice President of Workforce Effectiveness, the President of the CWA and the President of the IBEW may review whether there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and, if the parties find repeated instances of violations or repeated instances of interference during the period up to the review, may implement a process for recognition based on ""card check"" to replace elections in all cases or, if not, this Agreement shall continue in effect for the remaining term of the Agreement.

Standing Joint Subcommittee on Testing
This will confirm our understanding reached during 1998 Bargaining that a CWAIBEW-Lucent Technologies standing joint subcommittee on testing will be formed. The subcommittee, to be appointed.by the bargaining chairs, will consist of four (4) representatives from the Unions, two (2) from IBEW and two (2) from CWA, and four (4) representatives from the Company.
Measurement and Selection Systems (M&SS), part of Lucent's corporate human resources organization, is the organization with sole responsibility for the development or selection, validation, and authorization of all tests and policy and procedures used in the selection of candidates for Lucent occupational positions. M&SS is responsible to ensure that such tests meet Federal and professional standards for relevance and non-discrimination.
If the committee identifies a test currently in use which has not been authorized by M&SS, the test will be suspended pending the outcome of a review and report to the committee by M&SS.
At least thirty days prior to implementation, M&SS wilt notify the members of the committee of the intent to implement a new test or to revise a test or critical test score. M&SS will communicate to members of the committee the following pertinent information concerning the test:
the purpose the objective
401
the need for the test or change the title(s) for which it will be a requirement the business groups which will use it
After receiving the information described above, if the committee so requests, a meeting will be held to explore appropriate ways for the Company and the Unions to make available opportunities to assist employees in development of the new skills or job knowledge. The committee will also be expected to identify and recommend ways to maximize the many advantages and resources offered through the Alliance, ETOP, and ERC's in meeting the goals described above.
In addition, the committee may explore other issues with M&SS, including such matters as an apparent low percentage of employees qualifying on a specific test. Where the Committee agrees, a Third Party Neutral (TPN) may be selected to review any disputed new or revised test for relevancy and validity, applying appropriate legal standards. The TPN shall guarantee confidentiality of all tests under review and shall not release test items or scores to any person or entity. The TPN shall make recommendations to the Committee about the disputed test or score. Nothing herein shall prevent the implementation or use of a test during the TPN review.
The committee will meet upon request of the members, but no less than four (4) times a year to review new or revised tests.

276. The Employer agrees that an employee may refuse to directly participate in such medical procedures and will not be subject to coercion, censure, unreasonable transfer, unreasonable assignment or discipline by reason of such refusal. An employee who has an assignment where participation in therapeutic abortion occurs and who conscientiously objects to such participation, shall notify his/her supervisor of this position in writing which may require reassignment or transfer.
277. In emergency situations where the immediate nature of the patient's needs will not allow for substitution, the patient's right to receive medical care shall take precedence over the exercise of the employee's individual beliefs and rights. In such cases, the Employer shall arrange for reassignment/transfer at the earliest possible opportunity.

281. Union Field Representatives shall be allowed access to appropriate materials in personnel files which are directly related to an alleged contract violation if the employee's written consent is presented to Personnel.

C. Joint union-management departmental meetings at the facility will be held at mutually agreeable times to introduce implementation plans to affected employees and to answer questions from affected employees.
D. Prior to implementation of layoffs, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss alternatives to layoffs that will minimize the impact on employees.

(a) Employees with one but less than two years' accredited service may exercise their option within twenty-five (25) miles.
(b) Employees with more than two years' accredited service may exercise their option within the collective bargaining unit.

SECTION 9.4.2.1. An employee not desiring to exercise his/her option does not prejudice his/herrightsfor recall from lay-off under the provision of this Article.

(a) An employee may not bump into a new job title classification when there is opportunity within twenty-five (25) miles of his/her current reporting location to bump in his/her own classification or into one previously occupied by him.
When the selected job requires the employee to
relocate, and more than one choice of location is

""permitted location, or alternate location, based on best
meeting the needs of the business, giving due weight to
the employee's desires.

If he/she elects to seek a job of lower classification previously held by him, his/her time in both jobs shall be additive for purposes of this provision.
SECTION 9.4.2.8. The employee who is displaced may exercise any privileges available to him under this Article.

Any such cause shall not extend the employee's right to report to work beyond twenty-four (24) months from the time of lay-off unless said employee shall have requested such extension in writing and the Company, in its sole discretion for justifiable reasons, expressly extends said period.
SECTION 9.8. An employee shall not be required to give up permanent employment to return for temporary employment with this Company in order to retain his/her accredited service.
SECTION 9.9. Length of accredited service as defined in Article 5, Section 5.1 shall control in determining the order in which laid off employees for each classification will be recalled in any district.
SECTION 9.10. When a laid off employee is recalled following a force adjustment, he/she shall be placed on the appropriate wage progression
23
schedule in accordance with the following:

(b) If he/she returns to a lower rated job, or to a higher rated job, he/she shall be considered as reclassified from his/her former job with wage treatment thereby as outlined in Exhibit A Wage Schedule Administration. This procedure will be applicable, as well, when a relocation is involved.
SECTION 9.11. Employees displaced by reason offeree reduction shall be returned to their previous classification and location, if they so desire, at the earliest opportunity. This provision shall supersede the provisions of Article 8 of this Agreement. Employees returned to a previous classification by application of this Section 9.11 shall be returned to the same position on that wage schedule unless the application of the provisions of Exhibit A of this Agreement would provide for a higher wage rate. This right of retransfer shall not exceed two years and apply only to the original job classification. Should the employee refuse retransfer, all retransfer rights are terminated.
SECTION 9.12.

Such termination allowance will also be paid to pension eligible employees who suffer loss of employment through layoff.
SECTION 9.12.1. Payments to regular part-time employees will be prorated based on average hours worked per week during the 13-week period immediately preceding lay-off.
SECTION 9.13. Termination allowance normally will be paid according to the Company's payroll procedures for the hours equivalent to the employee's regular work week to the extent of the total allowance granted. LUMP SUM PAYMENT WILL BE MADE ONLY WHEREIN IT BECOMES CONDITIONAL UPON SUCH PAYMENT THAT NO FURTHER OBLIGATION RESTS UPON THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THAT FORMER EMPLOYEE. Employees are entitled to no other benefits when on lay-off except those covered under Article 8, Section 8.4, and under this Article 9.
SECTION 9.13.1. Termination payments made will be exclusive of earned vacation payments to which the employee may be entitled.
SECTION 9.13.2. Whenever any employee who has been paid termination allowance is subsequently reemployed and is again terminated, termination allowance in the instance of the second, or subsequent, termination will be computed on the basis of total accredited
24
service less payments previously received.
SECTION 9.14. No termination allowance shall be due to an employee in any case where termination is the result of (a) voluntary or involuntary retirement on pension or (b) death, or (c) termination for transfer between companies, or (d) resignation or quit by the employee, or (e) dismissed for cause, or (f) as a result of any sale or other disposition by the Company of the exchange at which the employee is working or at which he/she is assigned to work out of, when the employee concerned is continued in the employment of the Company or of the new management of the exchange.
SECTION 9.15. If an offer for recall within a twenty five (25) mile radius from the employee's previous reporting center is made when an employee is receiving termination allowance payments, such payments will be immediately discontinued.

EXHIBIT A
WAGE SCHEDULE ADMINISTRATION
SECTION A. Progression of increases within the wage schedule are to proceed according to ""Interval To Increase"". An employee is to be paid at least the start rate but not in excess of the maximum rate of the wage schedule for their job classification. An employee's wage rate within the wage schedule is not necessarily determined by total service with the Company.
SECTION A.1. ""Interval To Increase"" is the required months of service between progression wage increases.
SECTION A.2. Progression increases for employees who have been granted wage credit shall proceed in accord with the interval to increase, or the remainder thereof, as designated by the position of the wage rate on the wage schedule.
SECTION A.2.1. Part-time employees will achieve progression increases based on cumulative hours worked equivalent to the appropriate interval to increase.
SECTION A.3. In determining wage rate progression, excused absences not to exceed 30 calendar days a year (22 accumulative work days) and non-worked paid time shall be considered as time worked. Changes in rate of pay shall be effective on the first of each pay period. If the change would otherwise become effective during the first half of the pay period, it will be set forward, and if the change would otherwise become effective during the second half of the pay period, it will be deferred to the first day of the next pay period.
SECTION B. If an employee is changed to another job on a higher wage schedule, the employee's rate is to be adjusted to the rate on the higher wage schedule that is immediately above the employee's current rate. If an employee is displaced by reason of force reduction and subsequently returns to his/her previous classification within two (2) years or less the employee will be returned to the same position on the wage schedule previously held. Subsequent progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase.
SECTION B.1. Employees on incentive plans other than the Team Performance Award will receive a wage adjustment to the next higher rate on the higher wage schedule, which results in a minimum increase of no less than seventy-five ($.75) per hour.
SECTION B.2. If an employee is changed to another job on a lower wage schedule, the employee's rate is to be adjusted to the rate on the lower wage schedule that is the same as or immediately below the
employee's current rate. Subsequent progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase. SECTION B.3. If an employee is changed to another job on the same wage schedule, there will be no change in rate. Progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase. SECTION C. Employees placed in-charge shall be paid $.75 an hour as a differential for each hour served in that capacity.

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
The following represents the understanding of the parties concerning the implementation of sections 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 of the Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy (Practice 117-300-000).
1. The Company will require that the observations that result in the requirement for drug and/or alcohol screening will be documented in writing by the management employee(s) who makes the observations.
2. It is not the intent of the policy to require a drug/alcohol screen as a result of a performance problem(s), in and of itself, without the presence of indicators that would cause a ""reasonable person"" to conclude that the individual could be under the influence of a drug or alcohol. This is to say that a single indicator that could be the result of many different conditions would not be the sole factor that would result in a requirement for a drug/alcohol screening.
3. The Company acknowledges that employees will have the right to union representation, as provided by the Weingarten decision, during the screening process. The Company has not agreed to representation that is beyond that provided in Weingarten.
4. At the time the specimen is collected, the employee will be provided the opportunity to have a split specimen. The 2nd specimen will be properly sealed and maintained as to be available for retest at the request of the employee and/or union.
5. The Company agrees that the employee who tests positive on both the screen and the confirmation test will have the option to request the second part of the original specimen to be released to a NIDA certified lab to be retested. The Company's responsibility for the chain of custody ends when the specimen is released at the direction of the second testing lab. This request must be made by the Union or the employee within ten (10) work days from the date the original test result is provided to the employee. The employee will notify the Verizon Medical Review Officer
and the Regional Labor Relations Director of his/her intention to have a confirmatory retest. Upon request, the employee will arrange for the retest. The employee is responsible for all additional costs. The results of this retest will be forwarded to the Company as soon as the results are available for the Company's consideration.
If the second test is negative the Company will reimburse the employee for all costs of such test.
6.
In the case of a ""positive"" test result, the employee shall be so advised by
the Company's medical review officer or designee on a confidential basis,
prior to the reporting of the results to the employer, and the employee
shall have the right to discuss and explain the results, including the right
to advise the employer's medical review officer or designee of any
medication prescribed by his/her own physician, which may have affected
the results of the test.
7.
The Company agrees to delete the portion of the consent form that reads
""I hereby release Verizon, its employees and any such designated
institution or person from any liability resulting from the medical
procedures outlined below"".
8.
The Company agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Union against
liabilities resulting from the implementation and administration of the
Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy.

The parties also recognize that the Union's goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding Neutrality and Consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former ""GTE Network Services Companies"" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former ""GTE Network Services Companies"" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1. Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the
116
parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a) Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti-
management.
(b) Management will not advocate that employees should not vote
for a Union to represent them.
(c) The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access
to employees to get their message communicated.
(d) Management will respond to employee questions and is
obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by
employees.
(e) The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be
characterized as a ""third party"" or ""outsider"".
(f)
Any written information distributed to employees by either party
relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties1 communications with employees will be shared
with the other. The parties' communications with employees
will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g) Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial
relationship.
(h) Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally
attacked.
(i)
Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as
institutions.
(j)
The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of
--
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called ""Consent Election"". This process will work as follows:
(1) As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use ""Consent Election"".
(2) The Union shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The ""show of interest"" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3) The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union's show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4) In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
119
Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the IBEW for access, Verizon Labor Relations staff, in conjunction with focal management and IBEW representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the IBEW representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the IBEW that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the IBEW are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the IBEW commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
Dispute Resolution
Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing
effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will,
in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties
themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in
conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate
IBEW representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and
the IBEW that such matters are dealt with by and between the
parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having
to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed,
however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been
made, but the matter remains unresolved, the process described
below will be utilized.
(b) The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either Verizon or the IBEW can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)
If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access
120
(i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and IBEW believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the IBEW agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
121
(g) All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and IBEW.
9.
Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry, Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the IBEW, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement

MetPay Program
The MetPay program is provided by Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and affiliates, Warwick, Rhode Island, a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The MetPay program is a voluntary program which allows employees to purchase Automobile Insurance, Homeowner Insurance, Renter's Insurance, Excess Personal Liability, and other personal property insurance through payroll deduction. The MetPay program offers group discounts to Verizon employees. The amount of the discount is governed by the state insurance regulations. Therefore, the discount varies by state. The program is administered by Metropolitan Property and Casualty. Verizon will deduct the premiums from the employee's paycheck as directed by Metropolitan. All administrative questions, claims, and questions should be directed to Metropolitan at 1-800-GET MET1 (438-6381) orwww.met.pav.com. The employees can also contact Metropolitan by calling the Verizon Benefits Center at 1-800-GTE-BENS (483-2367). The call will be transferred to a Metropolitan Representative. The Verizon Benefits Center can not answer any questions regarding the MetPay program. The program is portable. Employees retiring from Verizon under the terms of the Verizon pension plans will retain the group discounts they had as an employee. Employees who terminate will retain the group discounts they had as an employee until the renewal date for the policy. On the renewal date, the premiums will be recalculated using Metropolitan's retail customer rates.

TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD
Verizon North Inc. (North Central Region) and the Internationa! Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 986 agree to develop and implement a Team Performance Award which will provide participating employees the opportunity to earn compensation based upon collective/team performance results.
ELIGIBILITY
All full-time and part-time regular hourly employees are eligible to receive an award if they are on a TPA team for 30 calendar days or more. Employees on other Incentive plans are not eligible, i.e., BSG, Consumer Sales, Retail, LiveSource.
AWARDS
Awards are based on performance toward objectives over the period of a calendar year. An award amount is determined for the applicable calendar year, a percentage of which may be earned by eligible employees, depending on team performance during that calendar year. The payout ranges from 0% to 120% of an established target.
The range of the Team Performance Award payout is as follows:
The 2002 target award is 4% payable in April 2003. The range is
0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
The 2003 target award is 4% payable in April 2004. The range is
The 2004 target award is 4% payable in April 2005. The range is
The payout percentage is applied to an employee's highest hourly basic rate of pay during the 26 pay periods of the calendar year.
Employees transferring between teams shall have their award prorated according to the time on each team.
In the event of reorganization which results in employees changing teams, awards shall be prorated based upon each team's performance.

--
Excused time off for union activity will be counted as time worked when computing Team Performance Awards.
5. BENEFITS TREATMENT
Team Performance Award payments are recognized in the calculation of Pension Plan benefits, Group Life Insurance, and the Hourly Savings Plan. Such payments will be applicable in the year payment is received. This is in accordance with benefit plan definitions.
All other benefits are in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and are based on rates shown in the hourly wage schedules.
6. TAXES. PERSONAL ALLOTMENT
Deductions for federal, state and local tax liabilities will be made in accordance with lump sum distribution tax laws.
Personal allotments such as savings bonds, and United Way contributions will not be made.
7. OVERTIME
The Team Performance Award payouts are for hours worked and must be included in overtime payments.
The overtime payment will be calculated as follows:
The Team Performance Award payout divided by the total hours worked equals the award hourly rate. This rate is then multiplied times .5 x number of overtime hours in the same calendar year for which the Team Performance Award was paid. The result of this calculation is the award overtime payment due the employee.

VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION (VEBA)
Verizon North Inc. (North Central Region) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 986 hereby mutually agree to the establishment of an Internal Revenue Code section 501 (c) (9) trust (also known as Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trust) to provide for the payment of medical or other permissible welfare benefits and administrative service costs for eligible employees who retire between November 25, 1990 and October 22, 2005 with a service or disability pension under the Verizon North Inc. (North Central Region) Pension Plan and their beneficiaries (hereinafter referred to as the Eligible Participants). This trust is being established to provide benefit security for the term of this Memorandum of Agreement.
The funding and operation of this trust will be determined by the
Company based on reasonable financial standards (and where
applicable, regulatory approval for recovery).
The Company agrees that funds placed into this trust will be used
exclusively to pay for the benefits and administrative costs described
below or for any other purpose permitted by law.
Effective July 1,1997, the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits for
the Eligible Participants shall be governed by the GTE RETIREE
OPTIONS Summary Plan Description, which may be amended or
discontinued by the Company at its discretion subject to paragraph 8
below.
In order to receive Retiree Medical Benefits, the retiree must pay a
percentage of the Retiree Medical premium (""Retiree Contribution
Percentage""). Similarly, the Company will pay a percentage of the
premium (""Company Contribution Percentage""), subject to Section 5
below. During the term of this Memorandum of Agreement, the Company
and Retiree Contribution Percentages will be based on the following
contribution:
164
Years of Accredited Service at Retirement
Percent of Health Care Premium Paid by Retiree
Less than 10 10 to 14 15 to 19 20 to 24 25 to 29
30 and over
100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 10%
(a) The Company shall determine the cost of providing Retiree Medical coverage (""Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums""). Further, it is the Company's intention to cap the amount it pays toward such Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums for employees who retire on or after July 1, 1997.
(b) When the Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums for the $350 deductible coverage option under GTE RETIREE OPTIONS reach the figures set forth in the chart below (""Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums""), the Company Contribution Amount shall be capped and the Company shall make no additional contributions towards Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums.
Coverage Category
Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premium
Retiree only (primary coverage) Retiree plus one dependant coverage Family coverage Medicare covered retiree
(per eligible life)
$ 6,314 $ 12,628 $ 14,144 $ 1,642
(c) The Maximum Company Contribution Amount applicable to each Coverage Category shall be determined by multiplying the applicable Company Contribution Percentage times the Capped retiree Medical Benefits Premium as set forth above for that coverage. The applicable Maximum Company Contribution Amount shall not increase when the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium exceeds the amount set forth in the chart above.
In order to receive Retiree Medical Benefits, the retiree must pay the Company the amount the Retiree Medical Premium exceeds the Company Contribution Amount as described in paragraphs 4 and 5 above (""Retiree Contribution Amount""). When the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium reaches or exceeds the Capped Retiree Medical Benefit Premium, the retiree must pay the Company the amount the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium exceeds the Maximum Company Contribution Amount.
165
The Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premium and the Maximum Company Contribution Amount set forth in paragraph 5 above is based upon the $350 deductible coverage option. If the retiree elects the $150 deductible coverage option, the Retiree Contribution Amount will increase by the amount the $150 deductible coverage option exceeds the $350 deductible coverage option. If the retiree elects the $1000 deductible coverage option, the Retiree Contribution amount will decrease by the amount the $1000 deductible coverage option is less than the $350 deductible coverage option (not to exceed zero). When the Retiree Medical Benefit Premiums for the $350 deductible coverage option reach the amounts set forth in the chart in paragraph 5, the Company Contribution Amount for all coverage options, including the $150 and $1000 deductible coverage options, shall be capped at that time and the Company shall make no additional contributions toward Retiree Medical Benefits.
The Company agrees to notify the Union and to discuss its actions should the Company determine that the funding or operation of the trust and/or applicable sections of this Memorandum of Agreement, other than pooling of claims experience and those sections relating to the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits, need to be modified or rescinded prior to the expiration of the Articles of Agreement. This notification will take place, in writing, within fifteen calendar days prior to the date of modification or rescission. This notification will specify the cause for and affect of this action. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on such changes, the funding or operation of the trust and/or applicable sections of this Memorandum of Agreement, other than pooling of claims experience and those sections relating to the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits, will be modified or rescinded at the Company's discretion.

ARTICLE VII Preamble
The parties agree that unit employees will be afforded not less than three options for medical insurance coverage for the First three (3) years of the contract and not less than two (2) options for the last year of the coniract. New employees, including Service Consumption Technicians (effective January 1, 2001). are eligible to select a provided option on the first of the month in which their second month anniversary occurs. All Service Consumption Technicians, including those hired after April 17. I*>ft7t will be eligible to enroll in all options January 1. 2001. The options are as set forth below. The provisions of this article, however, are merely to provide for the stated options, to memorialize the parties' agreements in the negotiation of the instant Collective Bargaining Agreement, and to highlight some of the provisions of the options provided. The actual specific provisions of each of the options are not set'forth herein, but are contained in the plan documents for each option, which are incorporated herein by reference. Such plan documents are available to unit employees as described below; reference must be made lo ihem regarding any issue of construction or application for each option's terms and benefits.
The Company and the Union express no preference between the options. Selection between the options will depend on an employee's and his/her family's individual circumstances. The Company agrees, prior to the open enrollment period of each year of this Agreement, to furnish all unit employees with plan summaries, a comparison chart of costs, benefits and responsibilities between the options, a what's new booklet and an individualized selection sheet, setting forth the. costs of each potential selection (or like materials that incorporate the same information), to afford unit employees with an informed basis to choose between the provided options. Employees must select one of the opiions within the open enrollment period of a given year, for his/her succeeding year's medical insurance coverage. The Company agrees to furnish all unit employees with the described information by November, but in any event, not less than 30 days before the last date of the open enrollment period of each (preceding) year. Employees are also eligible lo select health care options upon a qualified status change, in which event the same information will be provided.
The three options are as follows: (i) one or more HMOs, or other managed health care plans (one or more of which may be in the form of an exclusive provider arrangement, or EPA); (ii) a point of service plan; and (iii) the
-42-
Traditional Medical Plan.
In general terms, the plan types may be described as follows:
Article VII (Section I, paragraph c) refers to the coverage and provisions of the Traditional Medical Plan. Article VII, (Section 1, paragraphs a) and b) refer to additional healih care choices employees have at Open Enrollment. This chart was designed to assist employees in making health care decisions.
Plan Type
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO/EPA)
How It Works
Relative Advantages
You usually must select a primary care physician (PCP) from the HMO's pool of doctors and pay a small fixed amount for each visit. Typically, the PCP must approve any trips to specialists and non-emergency visits to HMO network hospitals.
You want to know in advance what your annual health cost will be, more or less. You'll need to be comfortable using only your HMO's physicians and hospitals and depending on your primary care doctor for referrals.
Point-of-Service Plan (POS)
Traditional Medical Plan*
These are plans administered by insurance companies or HMO's that let members go 10 providers without a PCP referral-for a price.
You want the coordinated care of an HMO with the safety net of being able to go to providers without a referral from the PCP.
You select your own doctors and hospitals and pay on a fee-forservice basis. You don't need a referral to see a specialist
Cost is not an issue and you have already established relationships with doctors who do not belong to a managed care network.
*The Traditional Plan has a Preferred Provider overlay. This is a network of doctors that offer plan discounted rates. Employees who use a PPO provider may have lower out-of-pocket expenses.
-43-
ARTICLE VII
With regard to the ""HMO option,"" see paragraphs (A) below, the Company agrees to offer one or more HMOs or other managed health care plans, as part of the flexible benefits plan, through the term of this Agreement. The Company may change the identify of the HMOs or other plans on a year-to-year basis; however, the plans offered during open enrollment will remain in place through the succeeding contract year, as long as the plan continues to be offered.
With regard to the POS. the Company may modify the fees, design, and providers, subject to the Company's agreement, set forth below, to provide notice and afford the Union the opportunity for input.
With regard to the 'Traditional Medical Plan option,"" see paragraphs (C) below, the Company agrees to offer the plan through the term of this Agreement.

For retirements from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002. the total minimum monthly pension benefit payable to age 62. including the ""supplement,"" will be $2.050. For union members retiring on a date from January I, 2Q0j through December 31, 2003. the total minimum monthly pension benefit payable to age 62, including the ""supplement,"" will be $2,100. For retirements from January 1, 2004 through December 31,2004, the total -63-
minimum monthly pension benefit payable to age 62, including the ""supplement,"" will be $2,100. Union members between the ages of 62 and Social Security normal retirement age may elect to continue his/her Company pension supplement until Social Security normal retirement age or begin drawing on any Social Security benefits prior to that date. Members may elect either option but not both. Each member will be required to sign a Social Security Release form and Pension Withholding Authorization form allowing recovery of overpayments should the retiree begin receipt of Social Security benefits and not advise the Company. If an employee retires with 30 years of credited service before age 55, the minimum monthly pension benefit shown above will be reduced to reflect the number of additional years the minimum monthly pension benefit will be received.
(d) Early Retirement Reduction Factor - The Company subsidizes the reduction factor used to determine pensions for employees who retire under age 62. Employees retiring between 55 and 62 will have their pension reduced by 5% per year. True actuarial reduction factors will be used for retirements prior to age 55 and combined with the subsidized rate to form a blended rate.
(e) Early Retirement Date - You may retire anytime after your 55th birthday, provided your age (as of your last birthday) plus your Years of Credited Service (as of the last anniversary of your employment commencement date) total at least 70. If you want to retire at age 60, you must have at least 10 Years of Credited Service. You may retire earlier than your 55th birthday if you have at least 30 Years of Credited Service. If you retire early, you may choose to have your pension payments begin immediately on your 65th birthday or on the first of any month between these dates. If you choose to have payments begin at age 62 or later, you will receive a benefit figured the same way us the normal retirement benefit based on your Years of Credited Service and final average monthly earnings as of the day you retired. Payments will be smaller than if you had worked until your normal retirement date.
(0 Normal Retirement Date - Your Normal Retirement Age under the Retirement Plan is 65. You will be eligible for a Normal Retirement Benefit on your Normal Retirement Date - the first of the month that falls on or follows your 65th birthday.
-64-
(g) Normal Retirement Benefit - Under the Retirement Plan, the amount you will receive each month as a Normal Retirement Benefit depends on several factors: (I) your Final Average Monthly Earnings, or FAME (see below). Note that FAME includes shift premiums and sales commissions, but not overtime or premium pay; (2) your Years of Credited Service; (3) the Covered Compensation limit - each year the IRS determines the maximum amount of earnings on which Social Security taxes and benefits are paid. This is called the taxable wage base. Covered compensation is the average of taxable wage bases for the 35-year period ending with the year you reach your Social Security normal retirement age. The average changes each year; and (4) your monthly annuity benefit, if any, under any other pension plan of the Company. Your monthly normal retirement benetlt is calculated according to the following formula:
Step 1. 1.33% X Final Average Monthly Earnings
1.33% X Years of Credited Service
(Final Average Monthly Earnings (FAME) is the highest average of your monthly earnings for the best 60 consecutive months in the last 15 years prior to your retirement or termination date. Normally, this is your last 60 months of work.)
PLUS
Step 2. 0.5% X (Final Average Monthly Earnings - Covered Compensation) X Years of Credited Service (up to a maximum of 35 years)
Step 3. The amount of your monthly benefit, if any, payable under any other pension plan of the Company or an affiliated company.
The normal retirement benefit described above is the amount you would receive under a Single Life Annuity - that is, monthly payments for life that end when you die, with no payments to a beneficiary after your death. If you are married, or if you choose some other way to receive your benefits, the amount you will receive will be somewhat less, to account for payments after your death to your spouse or other beneficiary.
-65-
(h) Forms of Pension Payment
(i) Standard Forms (Automatic unless you elect otherwise, with spousal consent, if applicable)
(a) Single Life Annuity: If you are not married at the lime you retire, you will receive a pension for the rest of your lifetime only, with no survivor payments at death.
(b) 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity: If you are married when you retire, you will receive a 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity. You will receive a reduced monthly pension as long as you and your spouse both live. If your spouse dies, your benefit increases to the unreduced amount. If you die, your spouse receives 50% of your reduced monthly pension. Reductions are based on your age and your spouse's age at the lime of your retirement.
(ii) Alternate Forms (Spousal consent required if married)
(a) Single Life: Monthly payments for the rest of your lifetime with no survivor benefits at death.
(b) Life Annuity with 10 Years Certain: You will receive reduced monthly benefits for your lifetime. If you die prior to receiving 120 payments, payment will continue to named beneficiary until 120 payments are made.

Attention: K. G. Dodd, Senior Business Representative
Dear Mr. Dodd:
This letter will confirm the parties' understanding concerning a drug-free workplace policy.
The Department of Defense haB issued emergency regulations mandating a drug-free workplace including the requirement that the Company certify that its operations are drug-tree. Accordingly, effective April 1, 1989, a drug-free workplace policy was implemented including testing based on reasonable suspicion applicable to all company employees. In addition, the Department of Transportation requires employers to conduct drug and alcohol testing on covered employees in accordance with the Department of Transportation regulations. Employees are also subject to testing when recalled to work from layoff provided such employees have been on layoff for a minimum period of twelve (12) months. Further, employees on the recall list, who are offered a non-bargaining unit position, are subject to preemployment testing. If an employee tests positive either at the time of recall or rehire, he or she will not be eligible for recall for a twelve 112) month period after which time the employee will be recalled and retested when the first available opening occurs. Testing will be conducted in accordance with the elements outlined in Company Practice 3-0-17. Failure on the part of an employee to cooperate in the program can involve discipline up to termination of employment. Failure of the Company to follow the direction of the government (our customer) can result in the loss of contracts, suspension of progress payments and other penalties.
The Company and the Union are committed to providing a safe workplace and to promoting employee health. Consistent with this commitment, a drug-free workplace policy with a view to maintaining a work environment that is free of the harmful effects of drug use or alcohol abuse will be implemented.
-102-
Supplemental Agreement #13
K, G, Dodd May 23, 2005 Page 2
Employees who use illegal drugs or who abuse legal drugB or alcohol, create aerious safety and health risks for all employees* and tend to be less productive, prone to greater abeenteeistn, accidents, health insurance costs and quality control problems and present security risks. This Supplemental Agreement embodies the parties' intention to cooperate in combating alcohol and drug abuse (""substance abuse"") among employees.
The Company currently offers a non-punitive Employee Counseling Program which offers assistance to employees with substance abuse problems. If possible, both the Company and Union representatives will encourage participation to those needing assistance in order to strive for a drug-free workplace and to assist those dealing with addiction. However, the Program cannot protect those employees who have refused assistance or failed to cooperate in the Program or whose work or disciplinary record does not support a referral to the Program.
Where appropriate, the parties agree to emphasize rehabilitation, not punishment, ae the first course in dealing with employees who have drug problems. Although the Company retains the right to discipline or discharge an employee for his/her first violation of the Company's Drug Free Workplace Program, discharge would normally not be in order unless the employee was already at a later stage of the disciplinary procedure or the initial incident relative to the disclosure of the drug problem was related to a dischargeable offense or the employee had previously participated in a rehabilitation program. Also, if the employee rejects an offer of rehabilitation, or if federal/state regulations preclude the retention of the employee in a covered position, the Company would be under no obligation to retain such employee.
If a Union member is to be questioned about substance abuse, the member, upon request, will have the assistance of a Onion representative.
The program will be in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.

3. The Employer reserves the right to request medical certification of inability to work due to sickness or injury, provided, however, such certification will not be requested prior to the second day of paid sickness leave, except for chronic and/or pattern cases.
H. The Employer reserves the right to become self-insured for State Disability Insurance at a later date.
SECTION 30 - PENSION
Macy's West will provide a pension plan and pension benefits for eligible employees covered under the terms of this Collective Bargaining Agreement consistent with the pension plan and benefits provided to the majority of the Macy's West'employees. The pension plan and the benefits shall change when changes are made in the plan affecting the majority of the Macy's West employees.
At the time of retirement of an employee covered by this Agreement, the Employer will notify the Union of the name and address of the employee, the date of the employee's most recent employment and the date of the employee's retirement.
SECTION 31 - PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS AND DISPUTES
Page 40 of 94
A. A ""grievance"" is defined as a dispute over the interpretation or application of an express term of this collective bargaining agreement alleging the agreement has been violated and as a result an employee's rights under this agreement have been adversely affected. Before filing a grievance, an employee who believes that the agreement has been violated and, as a result, her/his rights have been adversely affected (except in instances of suspension or discharge) is encouraged to resolve the issue with her/his immediate supervisor. In the first alternative, the employee's assigned shop steward shall meet with the employee's store manager or designee and shall attempt in good faith to resolve the issue. In the second alternative the employee shall contact her/his Union Membership Service Representative or Business Agent who shall meet with the Employer's designated representative and shall attempt in good faith to resolve the issue. If the dispute is unresolved following this aforementioned meeting, the employee may then request a grievance be filed by the Union.
B. A grievance to be considered as properly submitted, must be filed within sixty (60) days of the date of occurrence to the designated representative of the employer, in writing, on the prescribed form fully completed with all information available to the Union, stating specific contract sections alleged to be violated, facts which show that a violation occurred, name of grievant(s), and specification of how the grievant(s) have been harmed by the alleged violation. For a grievance to be considered timely filed such information will be provided in a manner as to make clear to a reasonable person the specific basis for the alleged violation. Within thirty (30) days following the submission of the grievance, it shall be heard at the weekly grievance meeting.
C. Grievances regarding a discharge must be submitted by the Union within ten (10) calendar days from the date the Union receives written notice of the discharge.
D. Any grievance not filed or heard within the time limits in Section 31 B and C will be deemed null and void. Time limits may be extended upon mutual agreement between the employer and the Union.
E. The parties shall establish regularly scheduled weekly meetings at which time grievances shall be discussed between the Employer and the Union. Other than discipline grievances (i.e. discharge, suspension, warning or demotion) at the time the grievance is discussed, the Union is required to set forth the facts supporting the grievance, witnesses to the facts and how these facts support a violation of the contract. Failure on the behalf of the Union to supply such information will cause the grievance to be deemed as untimely under the provisions of Section 31 (A). Failure by the Employer to respond to a grievance within fourteen (14) calendar days from the original weekly grievance meeting shall cause the Employer to comply with the remedy requested.
F. The Union and the Employer agree to discuss issues separately from the ""grievance"" discussion in the
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract, htm
Page 41 of 94
same meeting. The parties further agree that those issues not covered by the express terms of this agreement shall not be grieved.
G. The parties shall establish a monthly Mediation session with a Mediator affiliated with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. At least two (2) weeks prior to said session, the Union shall list the outstanding grievances that have been deadlocked at the weekly meetings that the Union wishes to pursue in mediation. Failure by the Union to list a grievance deadlocked at a weekly meeting will be considered a waiver of the Union's right to proceed to Mediation. If the parties are unable to agree on a resolution, the Mediator shall make an immediate written recommendation. Said recommendation shall not be binding and shall not be admissible as evidence in any arbitration, except as may be necessary for the allocation of costs and expenses as set forth below.
H. Said weekly and monthly meetings shall not be cancelled except for unusual circumstances.
I. If the matter is not resolved following the mediation session, the Union may, within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the written documentation from the Mediator, request in writing that the matter be submitted to binding arbitration. Submitted with the request for arbitration must be a list of issues the Union is requesting the arbitrator to hear. Failure by the Union to request arbitration within such time frames or to submit the list of issues will be considered a waiver of the Union's right to proceed to arbitration. Within fourteen (14) days after the Union specifies the issue(s) to be submitted the Company must set forth any objections to the formulation of the issue(s) by the Union and propose alternative formulation(s). Failure of the Company to respond and set forth alternate formulations will be deemed an acceptance of the issues as formulated by the Union.
J. The impartial arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, he/she shall be selected by the strike-off method from a list of qualified and experienced labor arbitrators obtained from the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Each party shall have the right to reject one list provided by the AAA. Each arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
K. An arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, change, or modify any provision of this Agreement, but shall be authorized only to interpret the existing provisions of this Agreement and apply them to specific facts of the complaint or dispute.
L. The selected arbitrator shall issue a written decision to the parties within thirty (30) days of the submission of written briefs to the arbitrator.
M. Any agreement reached at the weekly meetings or the monthly mediations and any arbitration decision shall be accepted as final and binding. If a party refuses to accept the recommendation of the
Page 42 of 94 Mediator and does not receive a more favorable determination by the arbitrator, the other party shall be considered the prevailing party. Expenses and verified costs of the prevailing party shall be borne by the other party, including cost of the arbitrator, reporting, and cost of meeting rooms incurred as the result of arbitration. In all other areas the parties will share the respective costs, one-half (1/2) to be borne by each side. Cost of attorney fees and the publication of the transcript shall be borne by the party incurring the fees.
SECTION 32 - NO STRIKE - NO LOCK OUT
A. There shall be no strike or lockout during the life of this Agreement.
B. The Union agrees to give the Employer at least ten (10) days advance written notice of any intent by the Union to honor a primary sanctioned picket line when established by another union directed at Macy's San Francisco and Stonestown.
C. A primary sanctioned picket line is one sanctioned by the UFCW International Union and the San Francisco Labor Council.
SECTION 33 - WAGE RATES AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
A. No contract rate herein provided shall be considered as other than a minimum rate, and no wage rate being paid to an individual employee as of the date of this Agreement above the minimum provided herein for the classification in which the employee is working shall be reduced.
B. Progression Schedule
Effective for all new hires after the date of ratification, for all classifications under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the progression schedule shall be:
Months of continuous service:
--
1. Inexperienced employees may be hired at the lowest rate of pay of the progression schedule for their classification of work.
2. An experienced employee who has had comparable experience in the retail and department store industry equivalent to the completion of one or more steps within the progression schedule for his/her classification of work, may be hired at the rate of pay for the progression step equivalent to his/her past experience, but such employee shall not be entitled to the highest rate in the progression schedule until s/he completes fifty (50) working days. However, this language does not preclude the Employer from hiring individuals above the maximum of the classification if such action is necessary to secure an individual. The Employer agrees that it will not act in an arbitrary manner in this regard and that it will not exercise its right herein, except in certain limited situations where the individual is of a reputation that will enhance the Employer's selling opportunities.
3. The rates of pay as established in 1 and 2 above will also apply to Seasonal Employees. Such employees shall not receive progressive wage increases during the period of their seasonal employment. Christmas Season Employees may be hired at 70% of the thereafter rate.
4. All progression steps will be adjusted according to their % of the thereafter rate consistent with the wage increases.
5. Effective June 1, 2003 the entry rate of pay may be $8.50 in selling grades I, II and III, and in all nonselling grades.
C. An employee who works more than fifty percent (50%) of the time in any one day in a classification calling for a higher rate of pay than his/her regular rate shall be paid for the entire day at such higher rate.
D. Biweekly Pay
The Employer, with thirty (30) days advance notice to the Union and the Employees, may convert at the same time as the majority of the other Employer's employees to a biweekly pay period.
E. The reclassification of a Regular employee as the result of a successful complaint of improper classification, shall be effective retroactively to the date the employee was placed in the disputed classification, or the date not more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the claim of
misclassification, whichever period is shorter.
Page 44 of 94
F. Should any job classification, new departments or division be established which are not covered by the Agreement and are not, by the terms of this agreement excluded from the coverage of the same, either party will, upon request of the other party, discuss wages applicable to such employees, and in the event the parties are unable to arrive at agreement as to the proper wage classification (including new commission arrangements) for the new classification, the matter may be submitted by the Union for disposition to an impartial arbitrator following the procedures contained in Section 31 of this Agreement.
G. WAGES:

If any Section of this Agreement or Appendices thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any Section is restrained by such tribunal pending a final termination as to its validity, the remainder of this Agreement and of any Appendix thereto, or the application of such.Section to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or as to which compliance with or enforcement of has been restrained, shall not be affected thereby.
SECTION 35 - TRANSFER AND REMOVAL OF WORK
No work now being performed by the employees within the bargaining unit shall be transferred or removed from the bargaining unit without at least sixty (60) days advance notice to the Union affected by certified or registered mail setting forth the nature of such intended change(s), dates of such change (s) and whether the change involves the elimination of a work or departmental operation or a change in method of operation wherein present bargaining unit employee's job or position would be eliminated. Any employee displaced as a result of those situations where the change results in the elimination of entire departments or work operations, or individual job functions within a department will, in order of seniority, be offered the opportunity to displace among the least senior employee in their same classification, provided the employee has the requisite merit and ability to perform the function of the least senior employee in accordance with Section 16 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The classification shall be defined as the major grouping (i.e. Grade C1 - 1a through f). The Employer shall provide whatever in-store training necessary to place the affected employee(s) in other available positions regardless of classification. In such situations, the affected employee(s) shall, have the option of accepting the available position or of going on layoff status.
The employer upon notice to the Union, agrees to institute a hiring freeze for the classifications, or work types affected by the transfer or removal, as well as for Grade ! selling positions, in an effort to create and/or keep for the affected employees, as many available open positions as possible.
Page 55 of 94
It is understood that such available open positions are the only positions that the affected employees can transfer to, and the hiring freeze does not apply to positions of the type that the affected employees would not be experienced or qualified for. Should all of the prospective displaced employees fail to accept an available position and choose to accept a layoff, the Employer shall fill the available position(s) in accordance with Section 16. The Employer agrees to offer to those on layoff status, as a result of the job elimination, positions that become available in the future before any new employee is hired. The offer of newly available positions shall be in accordance with Section 16, and this Section shall have priority and precedence over Section 17E.
In those situations cited above if the Union has served notice on the Employer within seven (7) days of receipt of the above-mentioned Employer notice, the parties shall meet as soon as possible to discuss the effects of such above-mentioned changes on the bargaining unit employees. If displacement results in loss of work resulting in layoff, then the Employer and the Union will meet to discuss the effects of such layoff and negotiate applicable severance and general release. Grievances by employees regarding the effects of the change(s) will be subject to all provisions of Section 31.
SECTION 36 - LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
The parties have agreed to establish a Labor Management Committee. This Committee will consists of a Business Agent of the Union, a Human Resources representative of Macy's and three (3) regular employees from the affected department(s) selected by the Union.
The Labor Management Committee shall meet once per quarter at a time and date mutually agreeable to Macy's and the Union. At least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting, the Union will advise Macy's of the subjects to be discussed at the Labor Management Committee meeting, so that Macy's will be prepared for the meeting. Following the meeting, the Human Resources representative will be responsible for following up with the members of the committee as to Macy's response.
The committee does not have the authority to interpret, alter, change or modify any section of the Collective Bargaining agreement, as well as, any Company policy or procedure not expressly covered in the agreement. Disputes over the interpretation or application of the contract or any alleged contract violations will continue to be heard solely at the weekly grievance meeting as defined in Section 31. The focus of the meetings shall be on issues of departmental or storewide concern and not be a forum for personal issues or gripes.
This letter of understanding remains in effect during the life of the contract, unless there is a mutual agreement to rescind or modify it.
SECTION 37 - TERM OF AGREEMENT
Page 56 of 94
This Agreement shall be effective the first day of June 2004 and shall remain in full force and effect until midnight May 31, 2008, and shall continue in effect thereafter from year to year unless either party hereto serves notice in writing sixty (60) days prior to the anniversary date of this Agreement of its desire to modify or change this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree that all issues between them are settled by this Agreement for the full term thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto set their hands, by their respective officers or representatives thereunto duly authorized.

APPENDIX C
ATTENDANCE POLICY
1. GENERAL ABSENTEEISM POLICY
Macy's California believes it is the obligation of every employee to report to work on time as scheduled each day and to work their entire schedule.
II. STANDARD
A. Punctuality in reporting to the job is expected from every employee and is essential to the smooth operation of the business.
B. 1. An absence occurs any time an employee is scheduled to work, but does not report. This does NOT include approved time off for vacation, holidays, bereavement leave, jury duty, approved leave of absence including pre-approved sick leave, or for any other written approved reason. All employees who are unable to report to work must inform the personnel office prior to their scheduled starting time and inform them of the reason for their pending absence, and how long they will be out An employee out of work due to illness for five (5) or more working days must provide Human Resources, for purposes of SDI, current medical certification of ability to work, or inability to work. In cases of Worker's Compensation, this certification must still be provided on the first day.
2. The Employer shall consider all circumstances presented by an employee (or union representative on his behalf) before classifying an attendance incident as an ""occurrence"" or ""irregularity"".
C. Absences shall be recorded into three (3) categories:
1. Reported absences: Those in which the employee is not reporting to work but has contacted Human Resources in accordance with the above procedures. If an employee reports an anticipated return date, they do not have to call in each day, unless the return date goes beyond original anticipated return date.
2. Job Abandonment: Failure to report to work within two (2) days of notification, or failure to report for two consecutive days.
3. Failure to Report Off: Unless serious illness or injury precludes an employee from reporting off work,
http://macys.locall01 .com/contract.htm
--
Page 73 of 94
3. Begin by being supportive. Tell the employee you want to help, don't lecture or become angry. If the employee expresses that they are having a personal crisis contributing to their attendance problem, suggest the EAP (Macy's Employee Assistance Program) to them if appropriate.
4. Use the documentation to show evidence. Don't rely on memory-have it in front of you. Ask if they have any comments.
VI. DEFINITIONS
1. ABSENCE-Failure of an employee to report to work when scheduled, or unscheduled time off the job (unless time off approved by executive or is a certified workers compensation illness/injury), consecutive absences for the same reason shall be deemed one incident.
2. TARDY-Failure of an employee to report to their work station within five (5) minutes of their schedule, or punch in within five (5) minutes of their scheduled time.
5-14 minutes = Vi point
15 or more minutes = 1 point
3. HOME EARLY-Failure of the employee to work their full scheduled shift if initiated by the employee and not approved by the manager.
4. LONG LUNCH-Failure of the employee to return from meals or breaks in their allotted or agreed upon time.
5-29 minutes tardy = 1/2 point
30 or more minutes tardy = 1 point
5. JOB ABANDONMENT-Failure to report to work within two (2) days of notification, or failure to report for two (2) consecutive days.
6. ATTENDANCE IRREGULARITY/INCIDENT-Any time an employee arrives late, leaves early, or is not at work (other than approved times specified).
VII. GRIEVANCE RIGHTS AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT http://macys.locall01.com/contract.htm
Page 74 of 94
A. Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to waive any of the Union's rights or obligations to grieve the . application of this policy to an individual employee who has completed the probationary period. The parties agree the Divisional Attendance Policy applies to all non-probationary bargaining unit employees.
Any employee who currently has nine (9) or less points under the Divisional Attendance guidelines shall be deemed to have zero points under this policy effective on date of approval by the parties.
An employee having either 10 or 11 points under the guidelines will be deemed to have nine (9) points under the policy, deletion to be the oldest incidents.
VIII. ATTENDANCE CREDITS
--
5. Leaye_is_Partially_Paid
You may be eligible to receive under the Paid Family Care Leave Act, up to 6 weeks partially paid leave under Family Temporary Disability Insurance, and you may also be eligible for short or long-term disability payments and/or workers' compensation benefits. Those plans are described in the benefit information brochure, ""Macy's More You"". If you request leave because of a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, your unused vacation accrual and any paid time off will first be substituted for unpaid Family and Medical Leave. If you request leave for a pregnancy-related disability, or any disability for your own serious health condition, you may use your unused vacation accrual if you desire. However, if you request leave because of your own serious health condition, your Family and Medical Leave will run concurrently with other Company provided leave, except where prohibited by law. The substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time does not extend the 12-week leave period. Further, in no case may the substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time result in you receiving more than 100% of your salary.
6. Me.dical_and_Qther_Ben^fits
For the first 12 weeks of an approved Family and Medical Leave, the Company will maintain your health benefits as if you continued to be actively employed. If you take a leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition and follow that leave with a leave to care for your
Page 79 of 94
newborn child, your leave may exceed 12 weeks, but we will only pay the company contribution for medical benefits for the first 12 weeks you are on leave. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid Family and Medical Leave, the Company will deduct your portion of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If your leave is unpaid, you must pay your portion of the premium through direct payment to Federated Finance. (The address is available from your Human Resources representative). Your health care coverage may end if your premium payment is more than 30 days late. If your payment is more than 30 days late, we will send you a letter to this effect. If we do not receive your co-payment within 15 days of that letter, your coverage will end. If you elect not to return to work for at least 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period, you will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the health benefit premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during your unpaid leave, unless you cannot return to work because of a serious health condition of you or a family member or other circumstances beyond your control.
7. Exemptionj o r J i i g h l y J ^
Highly-compensated employees (i.e., the highest paid 10% of salaried employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite) may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if restoration of employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the Company. The Company on a case-by-case basis will make this fact-specific determination. The Company will notify you if you qualify as a ""highly compensated"" employee, if the Company intends to deny reinstatement, and of your rights in such instances.
8.Jotexm&tent_anJJ?^
Leave because of a serious health condition, including pregnancy-related disabilities, may be taken intermittently (in separate blocks of time due to a single health condition) or on a reduced-leave schedule (reducing the usual number of hours you work per workweek or workday) if medically necessary. Employees also may be eligible for intermittent leave for bonding purposes following the birth or placement of a child in increments of two weeks, except for two occasions where the amount of time can be less. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your salary based on the amount of time actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position that better accommodates your recurring leave and has equivalent pay and benefits.
9. Retuj:nirig_from_Leaye
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition, (except if you are taking intermittent leave) you will be required to provide medical certification that you are fit to resume work. Employees failing to provide a required Return to Work Medical Certification will not be permitted to resume work
Page 80 of 94
until it is provided. Under most circumstances, an employee who returns from Family and Medical Leave will be reinstated to his or her original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. However, an employee has no greater right to reinstatement than if she or he had been continuously employed rather than on leave. In addition, employees who do not return to work are not entitled to an accrual of seniority or employment benefits that may have occurred during a leave period.
10. Extended_LeaveJjor_Serio_us_HealthjC.ondU
Leave taken because of your own serious health condition may be extended where it appears an extension will allow you to return to work in the readily and foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Such extended leave is based on: (1) written request to the Company; (2) medical certification that the serious health condition has continued and an extension of leave will allow you to return to work in the readily foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) approval by the Company. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled date or if you do not request in advance an extension of the agreed-upon leave, providing appropriate documentation, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your job. If you request an extension of your leave beyond the initial 12-week period, submit the request and supporting documents before your original leave expires. In addition, you must provide an updated medical certification each month that the leave is extended. Reinstatement is not guaranteed on an extended leave and depends on Company needs.
1 1 . No_VVork_While_on_Leay.e
Working a non-Company job inconsistent with the restrictions provided by your health care provider while on Family and Medical Leave or any other authorized leave of absence is considered a voluntary resignation. Unless on intermittent leave, you may not perform any work for the Company during the time period your health care provider certifies you are disabled from work.
CALIFORNIA PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE
If you are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, you are eligible to take a pregnancy disability leave (""PDL""). If you are affected by pregnancy or a related medical condition, you are also eligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less strenuous or hazardous duties, if such a transfer is medically advisable and can be reasonably accommodated. In addition, if it is medically advisable for you to take intermittent leave or work a reduced leave schedule, the Company may require you to transfer temporarily to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave. The PDL is for any period(s) of actual disability caused by your pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition up to four months (or 88 workdays
Page 81 of 94
for a full-time employee) per pregnancy. The PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time, but can be taken on an as-needed basis. Time off needed for prenatal care, severe morning sickness, doctor-ordered bed rest, childbirth, and recovery from childbirth is covered by your PDL. Generally, we treat your pregnancy disability the same as we treat other disabilities of similarlysituated employees.
You are required to obtain a certification from your health care provider of your pregnancy disability or the medical advisability of a transfer. The certification should include: the date on which you became disabled due to pregnancy or the date of the medical advisability of a transfer; the probable duration of the period(s) of disability or the period(s) for the advisability of a transfer; and, a statement that, due to the disability, you are either unable to work at all or to perform any one or more of the essential functions of your position without undue risk to yourself or to other persons; or a statement that, due to your pregnancy, a transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or duties is medically advisable. As a condition of your return from PDL, or transfer, the Company requires you to obtain a release to return to work from your health care provider stating that you are able to resume your original job duties.
At your option, you can use your unused vacation accrual for the year as part of your PDL before taking the remainder of your leave on an unpaid basis. Macy's Disability leave runs concurrently with PDL. The substitution of any paid leave will not extend the duration of your PDL. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled return date or request in advance an extension of the agreed upon leave with an appropriate medical certification, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your employment with the Company. Failure to notify the Company of your ability to return to work when it occurs, or your continued absence from work because your leave must extend beyond the maximum time allowed, may be deemed a voluntary resignation of your employment with the Company, unless you are entitled to Family and Medical Leave. Upon your return from PDL, you will be reinstated to your same position in most instances. Taking a PDL may affect certain of your benefits. If you want more information regarding our eligibility for a leave and the impact of the leave on your benefits, please contact your Human Resource representative. Please refer to the ""Family and Medical Leave"" policy in this Handbook for additional information. If you remain disabled after you have exhausted PDL benefits, you may be eligible for additional leave under other laws and/or Company policy. See Human Resources.
CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT (""CFRA"")
The following notice reviews in detail the California Family Rights Act:
THE LEAVE POLICY
Under the CFRA, you are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid Family and Medical
http://macys.loca! 101 xom/contract.htm
Page 82 of 94
Leave within any 12-month period and be restored to the same or a comparable position upon your return from leave provided: (1) you have worked for the Company for at least 12 months, and for at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months; and (2) are employed at a worksite that has 50 or more employees within a 75 mile radius. The 12-month period in which you may take 12 weeks of leave will be measured as a ""rolling"" 12-month period dating back from the time you request leave to begin.
REASON FOR LEAVE
You may take leave under the CFRA policy for any of the following reasons: (1) the birth of a child and to care for such child; (2) the placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care and to care for such child; (3) to care for a spouse, child, or parent (""family member"") with a serious health condition; or (4) because of your own serious health condition which makes you unable to perform an essential function of your job. Leave for reasons (1) or (2) must be completed within the 12-month period beginning on the child's date of birth, adoption, or placement. If both spouses are employed by the Company and they request leave because of reasons (1) or (2), they may only take a combined total of 12 weeks leave for such purposes during any 12-month period.
NOTICE OF LEAVE
If your need for leave is foreseeable, you must give the Company at least 30 days prior notice of the need for leave, preferably written. If this is not possible, you must at least give notice as soon as practicable (generally within one to two business days of learning of your need for leave). Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delay of leave. Additionally, if you are planning a medical treatment, you must consult with the Company first regarding the dates of such treatment. Where the need for leave is not foreseeable, you should notify the Company as soon as possible and practical.
MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
If you are requesting leave because of your own or a covered family member's serious
--
Leave is Partially Paid
You may be eligible to receive under the Paid Family Care Leave Act, up to 6 weeks partially paid leave under Family Temporary Disability Insurance, and you may also be eligible for short or longterm disability payments and/or workers' compensation benefits. Those plans are described in the benefit information brochure, ""Macy's More You"". If you request leave because of a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, your unused vacation accrual and any paid time off will first be substituted for unpaid leave. If you request leave for a pregnancy related disability, or any disability for your own serious health condition, you may use your unused vacation accrual if you desire. However, if you request leave because of your own serious health condition, your leave will run concurrently with other Company provided leave, except where leave is provided to California employees for pregnancy disability. The
substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time does not extend the 12-week leave period. In no case may the substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time result in you receiving more than 100% of your salary.
MEDICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS
For the first 12 weeks of an approved Family and Medical Leave, the Company will maintain your health benefits as if you continued to be actively employed. If you take a leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition and follow that leave with a leave to care for your newborn child, your leave may exceed 12 weeks, but the Company will only pay the company
Page 84 of 94
contribution for medical benefits for the first 12 weeks you are on leave. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid leave, the Company will deduct your portion of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If your leave is unpaid, you must pay your portion of the premium through direct payment to Federated Finance. The address is available from your Human Resources representative, who also will provide you with a schedule of payments. Your health care coverage may end if your premium payment is more than 30 days late. If your payment is more than 30 days late, we will send you a letter to this effect. If we do not receive your co-payment within 15 days of that letter, your coverage will end. If you elect not to return to work for at least 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period, you will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the health benefit premiums paid by the Company to maintain coverage during your unpaid leave, unless you cannot return to work because of a serious health condition of you or a family member or other circumstances beyond your control.
EXEMPTION FOR HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES
INTERMITTENT AND REDUCED SCHEDULE LEAVE
RETURNING FROM LEAVE
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition, (except if you are taking intermittent leave) you may be required to provide medical certification that you are fit to resume work. Employees failing to provide a required Return to Work Medical Certification will not be permitted to resume work until it is provided.
Page 85 of 94
Under most circumstances, an employee who returns from CFRA will be reinstated to his or her original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. However, an employee has no greater right to reinstatement than if she or he had been continuously employed rather than on leave. In addition, employees who do not return to work generally are not entitled to an accrual of seniority or employment benefits that may have occurred during a leave period.
EXTENDED LEAVE FOR SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS
Leave taken because of your own serious health condition may be extended where it
appears an extension will allow you to return to work in the readily and foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Such extended leave is based on: (1) written request to the Company; (2) medical certification that the serious health condition has continued and an extension of leave will allow you to return to work in the readily foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) approval by the Company. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled date or if you do not request in advance an extension of the agreed-upon leave, providing appropriate documentation, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your job. If you request an extension of your leave beyond the initial 12-week period, submit the request and supporting documents before your
original leave expires. In addition, you must provide an updated medical certification each month that the leave is extended. Reinstatement is not guaranteed on an extended leave and depends on Company needs.

ARTICLE VI WORKWEEK AND PAYMENT OF WAGES
6.1
The work week, for pay purposes, shall commence at 8:00 A.M., on Monday and end at 8:00 A.M., the following Monday. Upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union, which mutual agreement shall be reduced to writing, the starting time on a particular job may be advanced to, but not earlier than 7:00 A.M., and the quitting time shall be eight and one-half hours after the starting time. However, no job shall start earlier than 7:00 A.M., and no Union nor Employer shall be responsible for obtaining or paying premium pay if a bricklayer reports for work earlier than 7:00 A.M.
6.2
It is hereby agreed that employees shall be paid on the job before 4:00 P.M. on Wednesday of the week following the week in which the work was performed, except where a holiday is celebrated on a Monday of the week in which payment is made, in which case payment shall be made before 4:00 P.M.Thursday of the said week. All payroll checks issued must have the contractor's name, his office or home address, and telephone number printed thereon. A detachable stub recording social security taxes and other authorized deductions shall be attached to all pay checks.
6.3 Time checks payable at the office of the Employer
shall be considered valid, provided the employee be allowed two hours for traveling time. Said traveling time shall be added to the time check by the person issuing the same. If he is not paid promptly upon his arrival at the office and is obliged to wait during working hours, he shall be allowed regular wages for such waiting time. When an employee is directed during the work day expressly to go from one job site to another, he shall be paid for all reasonable time spent in traveling from the initial site to the other site.
6.4 When an employee is discharged he shall be paid
5
in full and also when he is laid off, if he demands it, except when the lay-off is caused by bad weather or joists high. When an employee quits of his own accord, he shall receive his pay on the next regular pay day.
6.5
If due to inclement weather or no work on a pay day, the contractor will make arrangements for the check to be on the job before 11:00 A.M.
6.6 Should an employee fail to receive his wages on
pay day he shall immediately report same to the Union with all facts concerning the case. The Union is permitted to stop any job of an Employer for any non-payment by that Employer of wages or fringes and may publicize such stoppage or attempted stoppage of work (anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding), and no employee shall be requested or required to work on any job for the Employer until all wages and fringes have been paid in full. Thereafter, the employees shall be permitted to return to their jobs without discrimination or reprisal.
6.7 The normal work week shall consist of forty hours
to be paid at the minimum wage rate. Time and one-half shall be paid for work performed in excess of forty hours in one week or in excess of eight hours in one day or on Saturday, except as provided in this section. No disciplinary action will be taken against any bricklayer who refuses to work more than eight hours in one day or forty hours in one week or on a Saturday. Saturday may be used as a make-up day at the straight time rate of pay when work is lost during the regular work week due to inclement weather. First preference for Saturday make-up work will be given to the crews on the job. A contractor who is proven to have worked a Saturday make-up day for any reason other than inclement weather shall not be eligible to work Saturday make-up for the remaining term of the contract. If a Saturday is used as a holiday make-up day, it shall be paid at double-time. Hours worked more than eight on any Saturday shall be paid at the double-time rate of pay.
6
6.8 Employees are to leave tool house at starting time
and be back in tool house at the start of lunch time; leave tool house at end of lunch time and be in the tool house at quitting time when the building is six stories or under.

6.9 A ten minute break shall be given in the morning,
commencing not earlier than two hours, nor later than three hours, after the start of the work day.
6.10
The Employer shall notify the Union not later than 4:00 P.M. on the preceding Friday, in the event his employees are to perform any work on Saturday. In so notifying the Union, he shall furnish the Union with his name and location where the job is to be performed. In the event there is a failure to notify the Union of intended Saturday work, the Union shall have the right to call for an immediate audit of the Employer's records at the Employer's expense.
6.11 No work shall be performed on Sunday or on any of
the following six holidays or the day observed as such holiday. New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas, without the permission of the Union. When such permission is granted, double-time shall be paid for the work performed on these days. No work shall
7
be performed on Labor Day except in cases of dire emergency and with the consent of the President of the Union.
. When a day other than the holiday is missed during a holiday week because of inclement weather, then Saturday may be scheduled and worked as a make-up day at straight time rates. In all other circumstances when work is scheduled and performed on a Saturday during a holiday week, doubletime shall be paid. In any event, any work performed on the Saturdays before Labor Day or Memorial Day will be paid at the double-time rate.

ARTICLE VII WAGES AND FRINGE BENEFIT
FUND CONTRIBUTIONS
7.1 The Local Unions comprising the District Council
participate in and are affiliated with various fringe benefit funds. The parties to this Agreement may agree to provide for different fringe benefit fund contributions for work performed within the geographical jurisdiction of one Local Union and another. As set forth in this Article, the recipient and division of fringe benefit fund contributions to be paid for work performed under this Agreement will depend on the Local Union affiliation of the employee performing the work or on the location where the work was performed.
8
7.2 If an employee is a member of a Local Union which
is a member of the District Council, that Local Union shall be the employee's ""Home Local."" If an employee has a Home Local, fringe benefit contributions on behalf of that employee shall be paid to the Depository Account for Employer Contributions, as provided in Article XXXIII, Section 33.27, for distribution to the fringe benefit funds with which the employee's Home Local is affiliated, or, if the employee has no Home Local, for distribution to the funds with which the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed is affiliated; except that with respect to contributions to the local apprenticeship and training funds, such contributions shall be distributed through the Depository Account to the local apprenticeship and training fund with which the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed is affiliated, regardless of whether the employee on whose behalf the contribution is made has a Home Local.
7.3 The ""Standard Payment"" shall be the wages and
fringe benefit fund contributions set forth in section 7.4. The parties to this Agreement may, through side letters or other appropriate written instruments, mutually agree from time to time that the fringe benefit contributions as to one or more Local Unions will be different than the Standard Payment, with such side letters or other written instruments to be negotiated and executed only by duly appointed representatives of the District Council and the Northern Illinois Mason Employers Council. If the parties to this Agreement provide for fringe benefit contributions different than the Standard Payment, the contributions paid for work by a particular employee will be based on the formula for the employee's Home Local if he has one. If the employee has no Home Local, contributions will be based on the formula for the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed, except that the contributions for an employee without a Home Local whose employment is covered by a reciprocity agreement will be based on the Standard Payment.

ARTICLE VIII JOINT TRUSTEESHIP OF LOCAL INDUSTRY PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT FUNDS
8.1 The Union desires that the Illinois Masonry Institute
and the Local Industry Promotion and Advancement Funds (with the exception of the Masonry Industry Advancement Fund [""Ml AP]) be jointly trusteed, with an equal number of Trustees representing Employers and employees, and they contend that such joint trusteeship is lawful under Section 302(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act. The Employers are agreeable to such joint trusteeship, subject to certain limitations, but they contend that Section 302(c) prohibits employee representatives serving as Trustees on such Trust Funds. Therefore, the parties agree that jointly administered successor trusts to those industry promotion and advancement funds shall be created, subject to the following limitations, and contributions required to be paid under this contract to those industry promotion and advancement funds shall be payable to the successor funds:
(a) The joint trusteeship of industry promotion or advancement funds shall be determined to be lawful by a final judgment issued by any federal court.
(b) The joint Boards of Trustees shall consist of five employer and five employee representatives, each of whom shall have an equal vote.
(c) In the event that less than five Trustees on a side shall be in attendance at a meeting, the votes of each Trustee present on that side shall be increased proportionately, so that all of the Trustees on a side who are present at a meeting shall be entitled to collectively cast a total of five votes.
(d) Seven affirmative votes shall be required to adopt a resolution of the Board ofTrustees. The successor trust funds shall not be used for the
19
purpose of providing apprenticeship training.

It shall include fabrication at the plant and setting on the job of all masonry components.
10.3
The following is the jurisdiction of work of the classification of specialists known as Sewer and Manhole bricklayers, which is within the work jurisdiction of the Union. This classification shall in no way be construed as to deny the bricklayer the right to do any or all of the same work.

33.32 Payment Bond:
A. Any Employer who is delinquent for sixty (60) days or more in making payments of wages, fringe benefit fund contributions, or any Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of employees pursuant to a check-off authorization shall, at the request of the Union, furnish a satisfactory surety company's bond to guarantee payment of wages and contributions to said funds and Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of an employee pursuant to a check-off authorization as required by this Agreement. The bond shall be in the amount of $5,000.00 if the Employer has three (3) employees or fewer working under this Agreement; in the amount of $15,000.00 if the Employer has four (4) to ten (10) such employees; in the amount of $30,000.00 if the Employer has eleven (11) to twenty (20) such employees; in
58
the amount of $45,000.00 if the Employer has twenty-one (21) , to thirty (30) such employees. The bond shall increase
$15,000.00 for each additional ten (10) employees.
The determination of the number of employees working under the Agreement for purposes of setting the amount of the bond will be based on the largest number of such employees within the twelve month period preceding the Union's request that a bond be posted but the Union may, at its sole discretion, request or agree to accept a bond in a lesser amount i if the Union determines that a bond in a lesser amount is reasonably likely to provide the security sought and that requiring 1 a bond in a greater amount would present a significant burden to the Employer. No action by the Union in requesting or agreeing to accept a bond in a lesser amount than otherwise provided from one Employer but not from another Employer will be deemed to violate the Most Favored Nations Clause of the , Agreement.
If an Employer becomes delinquent for sixty (60) days with respect to any of the specified obligations, it is required to post a bond upon request by the Union even if it cures or has cured the delinquency.
The Union may, at its sole discretion, accept a cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other security instrument which it deems proper, and if such an alternate security instrument is provided and accepted, all references in this Article and elsewhere in this Agreement to a ""bond"" shall be deemed to apply to such alternate security instrument.
Any Employer which is required to post a bond pursuant to this section shall maintain the bond until it has satisfied all obligations under the Agreement and has incurred no delinquencies for two years.
B. In the event that a bond is posted, delinquencies occur, recovery is sought against the bond, and the total unpaid wages and benefit fund contributions and Union dues exceed the amount of the bond, payment shall be apportioned among all wages and benefit contributions and Union dues on
59
a pro rata basis, whereby each wage claim and each fringe benefit obligation and each payment of Union dues will be paid at the same percentage.
C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Union is not required to utilize the grievance or arbitration procedure if an Employer which may be required to post a payment bond fails to do so within ten days of the time the Union submits a written request to the Employer to do so. The Union may, upon expiration of such ten days, seek immediate relief in any court of proper jurisdiction. If the Union utilizes this provision of the Agreement to obtain an order from a court requiring an Employer to furnish a payment bond, the Union shall be entitled to recover from that Employer all reasonable legal fees and cost incurred, and shall be entitled to recover such fees and costs as a part of. the legal action without resort to the grievance or arbitration procedure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, if an Employer which is required to post a payment bond fails to do so within ten days of the time the Union submits a written request to the Employer to do so, the Union may, at its sole discretion, withdraw the employees of the Employer or take other economic action, and may publicize its dispute with the Employer regarding the obligation to post a bond. The Union's rights to engage in such actions and to take other steps as described in this Section to obtain a bond are cumulative. No decision or action by the Union to use one or more methods of seeking to obtain a bond from one Employer but not from another Employer will be deemed to violate the Most Favored Nations Clause of the Agreement.
D. If any party to this Agreement believes there is a reasonable possibility that wages, contributions required by this Article, or Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of an employee pursuant to a check-off authorization will go unpaid and will be lost if no action is taken to obtain a payment bond prior to an Employer being delinquent for sixty (60) days or more, that party may, upon 72 hours written notice to such Employer, present the question to the Joint Arbi-
60
tration Board (""JAB"") as discussed in Article XII of this Agreei ment. The JAB will be required to convene and hear evidence presented by the party raising the issue, along with any evi1 dence presented by or on behalf of the Employer in question.
If the JAB determines there is a reasonable possibility that the payment of wages, contributions required by this Article, or the Union dues will not be made and will be lost in the absence of such action, it shall require the employer to obtain a
i payment bond as discussed in Paragraph A of this Section, notwithstanding the fact that no delinquency exists or that a i delinquency has not existed for sixty (60) days. In determining whether a payment bond should be required under these circumstances, the JAB cannot act in an arbitrary manner. Without limiting the right of the JAB to require an Employer to ob-
' tain a payment bond under the provisions set forth in this parai graph for other reasons, one reason the JAB may require an Employer to obtain such a bond is that the Employer, or an i owner or principal of the Employer, is or was associated with or affiliated with an Employer which had delinquencies on previous occasions. If the JAB rules an Employer should obtain a payment bond pursuant to the terms of this paragraph, the Employer must do so within ten days of receipt of written notice of such decision by the JAB and if the Employer fails to do so, the Union may then utilize the procedures set forth in Paragraph C of this section.
E. Any employer who signs or becomes bound to this collective bargaining agreement with the Union after May 31, 2000 (""New Employer"") will be required within 14 days of signing or becoming bound to the Agreement to post a bond in an amount determined by the number of its employees in accord with the formula set forth in Section 33.32 A. The provisions of Section 33.32 A., B., and C. shall apply to such bonds posted by a New Employer except that (1) in addition to the remedies provided in Section 33.32 C. available to the Union, the Union may also cancel the collective bargaining agreement with the New Employer for failing to comply with the obligation to post a bond, which cancellation will be effective upon the Union giving the New Employer written notice it is exercising this right, and (2) any New Employer who posts such a bond as required and has no delinquencies for two
61
years from the date of signing or becoming bound to the Agreement shall be permitted to cancel the bond and thereafter shall be subject to a bond obligation only in accord with Sections 33.32 A. and D.
33.33 Apprentices:
A. In order to maintain a sufficient number of skilled mechanics, the necessity for employment of apprentices is hereby recognized, and the employment and proper training for as many apprentices as is reasonable and practicable shall be encouraged by all parties to this Agreement. To this end the Employers shall be required on the basis of a fair quota system established by the Trustees of the applicable Apprenticeship Program to employ as many apprentices as the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Program shall determine. Apprentices shall be under the complete control and jurisdiction of the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Program.
8. Apprentice Training: The Apprenticeship Program shall train apprentices adequately in safety and first aid.
C. Wages of Apprentices: The wages of apprentices shall be as follows:
50% of Journeyman's wage scale for 1 st six months 60% of Journeyman's wage scale for 2nd six months 70% of Journeyman's wage scale for 3rd six months 80% of Journeyman's wage scale for 4th six months 90% of Journeyman's wage scale for 5th six months 95% of Journeyman's wage scale for 6th six months
D. Each Employer shall employ one (1) apprentice for each five (5) journeymen bricklayers when said apprentices are available, except that on all residential work three stories or less with a maximum of twenty-five dwelling units per structure, the Employer may, at his sole option, employ up to two apprentices for each journeyman bricklayer.
E. In order to expose apprentices to all aspects of the trade, apprentices shall not operate a saw for more than
62
eight (8) hours in any one work week except in unusual circumstances. No apprentice shall be entitled to any back pay or other monetary remedy for any violation of this provision, it being understood that this provision shall be enforced solely by a cease and desist remedy for any such violation.
F. An apprentice category designated ""Novice Trainee"" will exist, with such category ceasing to exist effective May 3 1 , 2004, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Employers may employ novice trainees to perform work covered by Article X. Each novice trainee must pay a $25.00 registration fee to the applicable Local Union and must produce the receipt for such payment while working as a novice trainee, and no Employer shall permit an individual to work as a novice trainee unless and until that individual presents the registration fee receipt to the Employer. Employment of each novice trainee is limited to a 200 hour probationary period, after which period the Employer must decide whether the novice trainee will be retained, either as an advanced apprentice through the Local 21 apprenticeship program or as an apprentice through the apprenticeship program of Local 14, 20, 27, 56, or 74, or be terminated. No individual may work as a novice trainee for more than 200 hours for any one Employer or a cumulative total of more than 200 hours for more than one Employer; and it shall be the responsibility of each Employer hiring an individual as a novice trainee to assure compliance with this requirement. The Employer must notify the District Council in writing when a novice trainee is either terminated or retained, and must do so within 48 hours of informing the novice trainee. Failure by the Employer to provide such written notice or otherwise abide by the requirements of this Section 33.33 may be grounds for the Joint Arbitration Board to impose an appropriate remedy, including barring the Employer from future employment of novice trainees. If the novice trainee is to be retained, it will be his or her responsibility to apply to the apprenticeship program affiliated with the appropriate Local Union, and such application will be treated as would any application for entry into that apprenticeship program. The decision of the Employer to terminate a novice trainee during or at the end of the probationary period will be at the Employer's sole discretion and will not be subject to challenge through
63
the procedures of Article XII.
Novice trainees will be paid 45% of the minimum wage rate set for journeymen. No benefit fund contributions or other payments except wages will be paid on behalf of a novice trainee unless he or she is retained after the 200 hour probationary period, at which point the Employer must pay Health and Welfare and Annuity contributions retroactively for the probationary period; and thereafter all contributions and payments will be made on a prospective basis. The Employer recognizes that novice trainees will not have received the safety and first aid training provided by the Apprenticeship Program, and must take proper steps to compensate for that lack of training.
An Employer may employ one novice trainee for the first ten or fewer journeymen in its employ. After the Employer uses an initial novice trainee, the Employer must abide by the ten to one ratio and at least one apprentice must be included among the ten journeymen when available. The Local Union in whose area the work is being performed must approve application of the ratio for employment of more than one novice trainee. Employers may only employ novice trainees if they are current on all fringe benefit fund contributions, and no Employer may employ a novice trainee if there is a pending Joint Arbitration Board decision with which it has not complied.
33.34 Refractory Provisions:
All refractory provisions shall be superseded by the International Union Agreement when negotiated.
33.35 Composite Crews:
For in-plant and precast installation work involving composite crews of Bricklayers and Boilermakers or Ironworkers, Bricklayer employees will be entitled to the most favorable show-up and premium pay provisions for such work.
64
ARTICLE XXXIV SAVINGS CLAUSE 34.1 Should any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement be found in violation of any federal or state law, based on final court decisions or rulings of authorized governmental agencies, then such terms and conditions shall become void and ineffective immediately on written notice to this effect from one party to the other, but all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 34.2 In the event there is a disagreement on the legal interpretation of said court decisions or rulings, the subject matter shall be promptly referred to the Joint Arbitration Board for final determination through legal counsel.

2. The parties hereby acknowledge that this Agreement represents an amicable understanding reached by the parties as a result of the unlimited right and opportunity of the parties to make any and all demands with respect to the employer-employee relationship which exists between them relative to the scope of bargaining.
3. This Agreement recognizes one certified bargaining unit. Each provision of this Agreement applies to that bargaining unit unless specified otherwise.
C. RECOGNITION
1. Pursuant to and in conformity with the certifications issued by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) of the State of California in case number SF-HR-13, the University recognizes AFSCME as the sole and exclusive representative for the purposes of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for all employees, excluding employees designated as managerial, supervisory and/or confidential by the University and all student employees whose employment is contingent upon their status as students, in the following described bargaining unit:
--
5. Standards
Included in the standards to be used by the arbitrator in reaching his/her decision shall be the following:

7. With the exception of Section G. below, the expedited arbitration procedure referenced herein shall be the sole and exclusive procedure through which the parties shall resolve disputes between them as to the inclusion or exclusion of employees in or from the bargaining unit. This procedure shall be used after discussions between the parties have failed to achieve resolution of such matters.
G. NEW CLASSES
1. When the University creates a new class and title within the occupational subgroups (OSG) included in this bargaining unit, the University shall mail a notice to the Union of the bargaining unit assignment, if any, of such class. The Union shall have 30 calendar days after mailing of such notice to contest the University's assignment. If the Union contests the assignment, the University and the Union shall meet and confer in an effort to reach agreement on the bargaining unit assignment for the class. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to PERB pursuant to Regulation 32781(a)(2) for resolution. If the Union does not contest the bargaining unit assignment within the 30 calendar day notice period, the unit assignment of the new class shall be deemed agreeable to the parties and PERB shall be so advised. Bargaining unit assignments made by the University which are contested by the Union shall remain as originally assigned by the University until such time as the parties are in mutual agreement as to a different assignment or, if such assignment is referred to PERB within the appeal period stated above, until resolution of the matter by PERB.

3. Assignment by the University of the pay rate to a new class as indicated above shall be consistent with the then-existing compensation and classification methodologies utilized by the University.
-8-
4.

If such a request is made, the parties shall meet within 30 calendar days of the request.
5. Pending discussion, if any, of the pay rate for a new class the pay rate originally assigned by the University shall remain in effect. An unquestioned rate or the rate determined appropriate by the University subsequent to any discussion with the Union shall be the rate assigned to the new class. Such rates shall not be subject to Article 9 - Grievance Procedure or Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.
H. ABOLITION OF CLASSES

ARTICLE 3 ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
A. Grievances which have not been settled under the procedures provided in Article 9 Grievance Procedure, may be appealed to arbitration.

An appeal to arbitration must be received by the Office of the Director-- Labor Relations, Office of the President within 20 calendar days of the mailing of the last preceding University written answer to the Union. The appeal to arbitration must be signed by the AFSCME Local 3299 Director and Proof of Service must accompany the appeal to arbitration. An appeal to arbitration is considered filed on the date it is postmarked. Grievances which are not processed within the above time limit, and/or which do not contain the appropriate Union signature, will be considered ineligible for appeal to arbitration. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to arbitration or heard in arbitration, the last preceding University written answer shall become final.
B. A request for arbitration utilizing the expedited grievance procedure provided in Article 9 - Grievance Procedure, Section H.2.f., may be made only by AFSCME in accordance with Section A. above. Request for arbitration under this section must include a copy of the completed grievance form.
C. Within 15 calendar days of service upon the University of AFSCME's appeal to arbitration of a grievance, the University shall acknowledge receipt of the appeal and shall indicate the University's office of representation for the grievance. The acknowledgement shall indicate the location to which all correspondence and contact should be made relative to the Arbitration Procedure and shall include a Proof of Service.
D. Within 30 calendar days of service upon AFSCME of the University's acknowledgement of a grievance having been appealed to arbitration as indicated in Section C. above, the parties shall attempt to mutually agree to the selection of one arbitrator from the permanent panel to serve as arbitrator for the appealed grievance.
E. The scheduling of the arbitration hearing date must be accomplished no later than 180 calendar days from the date the grievance was originally appealed to arbitration. Failure to invoke the process described in Sections G and H below, within 180 calendar days will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall become final.
F. Time limits related to the Arbitration Procedure may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties in advance of the expiration of the time limit. Deadlines which fall on a day which is not a campus/Laboratory business day will automatically be extended to the next business day.
-9-
G. SELECTION OF THE ARBITRATOR
1. If the parties mutually agree to the selection of the arbitrator, a letter signed by both parties shall promptly be sent to the arbitrator notifying him or her of his/her selection and requesting a hearing date. In the event the parties anticipate a hearing involving more than one day, they shall at the time of notice to the arbitrator of his or her selection estimate the number of days the hearing will require. Available arbitration date(s) shall not be any earlier than 21 calendar days from the arbitrator's receipt of his or her selection to hear the arbitration.
2. If the parties fail to reach mutual agreement as to the selection of an arbitrator for a grievance appealed to arbitration pursuant to Section D above, selection shall be made as follows:
a. The names of five members from the northern or southern permanent panel group shall be drawn by blind lot.
b. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list of five. The flip of a coin shall determine the party to begin the alternate process of the striking of the names.
c. The one name remaining after each party has stricken two names shall be the arbitrator designated to conduct the hearing.
d. If both parties mutually disagree with the arbitrator name which has been selected using the above process, the process shall be repeated in its entirety in order to determine a selected arbitrator.
e. If, after two attempts, the parties mutually disagree with the arbitrator selected, then one party, chosen by the flip of a coin, shall draw one name by blind lot from the northern or southern group and that arbitrator shall hear the arbitration case.
H. SCHEDULING THE ARBITRATION HEARING
1. Should the parties be unable to agree to a hearing date, the authority to schedule the hearing rests with the arbitrator. The parties may, however, mutually agree in writing in advance to extend the 180-day time limitation. In such cases the arbitrator shall be informed of the parties' mutual agreement and shall be provided with a copy of such written agreement.
2. Should the Union make a request that the grievance be placed in abeyance for any reason, the period of abeyance shall not exceed six months. The Union further agrees that grievances placed in abeyance shall have the time limits tolled during this period. Failure by the Union to reactivate the grievance within the six-month time limit following request that it be held in abeyance will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall become final.
I. ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
1. The Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement may be invoked only by AFSCME.
2. Unless there is mutual agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue to be heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the matter which was the subject of the grievance as stated at Step 3 or in the case of an expedited grievance, as stated at the Step 2 hearing. The decision of the arbitrator will be restricted to whether there is a violation of the Agreement as set forth in the last preceding written answer of the University. If such a violation is found, the arbitrator shall specify the remedy in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
3. The arbitration hearing shall provide an opportunity for AFSCME and the University to examine and cross examine witnesses under oath or affirmation and to submit relevant evidence. AFSCME shall not seek to introduce new issues or allegations at the arbitration hearing.
- 10 -
Evidence or facts which were known to AFSCME but not introduced during the last preceding formal grievance step of the Grievance Procedure shall not be introduced by AFSCME at the arbitration hearing.
4. Settlement offers made during the Grievance Procedure shall not be introduced as evidence in the arbitration hearing.
5. When the University has the information upon which to base a challenge to the arbitrability of a grievance and has such information prior to the selection of an arbitrator, the University shall inform the Union in writing of the intent to raise the issue of arbitrability prior to the selection of the arbitrator.
6. Should arbitrability of the subject matter be an issue, a separate arbitrator shall be appointed to determine the question of arbitrability unless the parties agree otherwise.
Should procedural arbitrability be an issue in addition to subject matter arbitrability, two arbitration hearings will be held using two different arbitrators with the hearing on the arbitrability of procedure being held first, unless the parties agree otherwise.
7. Where two or more grievances are appealed to arbitration an effort will be made to consolidate the grievances and agree upon a single arbitrator.
8. Arbitration hearings conducted pursuant to this Article shall be closed unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in advance and in writing.
9. The arbitrator shall have the obligation of assuring that all necessary facts and considerations are brought before him or her by the representatives of the parties at the hearing. In all respects he or she shall assure that the hearing is a fair one. The arbitrator shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence and testimony offered. The arbitrator may receive and consider evidence but shall give appropriate weight to any objections made. All documents to be considered by the arbitrator shall be filed at the hearing.
10. The decision of the arbitrator on any issue properly before him or her shall be final and binding upon the University, the Union and all employees. The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to determining whether the University has violated the provision(s) of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award which would, in effect, grant the Union or the employee(s) any matters which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
11. The arbitrator shall have the authority to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses upon the reasonable request of either party but not upon his/her own motion. The arbitrator shall have no authority to subpoena documents nor shall the parties be required or ordered to produce lists of witnesses prior to the hearing. The expense of service and appearance fees, if any, shall be borne entirely by the party requesting the subpoena of witnesses and the arbitrator shall, in advance of the hearing date, inform each party of the identity of witnesses subpoenaed by the other party.
12. Either or both parties may, at their discretion, file briefs with the arbitrator. The order and time limits of briefing shall, on a case by case basis, be as mutually agreed upon by the parties or as specified by the arbitrator. Briefing time limits may be extended if mutually agreed upon by the parties.
13. The arbitrator shall consider the evidence presented and render a written decision within 30 calendar days of the close of the record of the hearing.
- 11 -
14. With regard to a grievance appealed to arbitration for which in whole or in part the remedy sought involves back wages or other monetary reimbursement, the University shall not, in providing such remedy as a result of an arbitrator's award or a settlement, be required to make any payment of wages or any other monetary reimbursement for:
a. Any period of time during which an extension of time limits has been granted at the request of AFSCME;

c. Any period of time earlier than 30 days prior to the date of filing of the Step 1 written grievance.
15. If the grievance is sustained in whole or in part, the remedy shall not exceed restoring to the employee the pay, benefits or rights lost as a result of a violation of the Agreement less any compensation from any source, including, but not limited to, Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Insurance benefits. The decision of the arbitrator, within the limits described herein, shall be final and binding.
16.

17. In any settlement of a grievance appealed to arbitration involving retroactive payments, the appropriate University and Union representatives shall expeditiously determine the identity of the payees and the specific amount owed each payee.

18. Awards involving monetary payment and/or credit shall be limited in their calculation to the utilization of the employee's actual and appropriate wage or benefit amount and shall not include the awarding of interest or any other payment/credit unrelated to a benefit amount or an hourly wage.

The University shall not be responsible for any lodging, travel or other expenses incurred by grievants, witnesses or Union representatives with regard to the arbitration hearing. The University shall not be required to grant without-loss-of-straight-time pay status to more than one employee Union representative for attendance at any one arbitration hearing.

Any arbitrator eliminated may not be placed back on a panel for two years.
O. In all cases appealed to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article and this Agreement, with the exception of those cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 - Discipline and Dismissal, AFSCME shall have the burden of proceeding and the burden of proof. The burden of proceeding and proof in cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 - Discipline and Dismissal, shall be the University's.
P. Under no circumstances shall any grievance involving employees engaged in the violation of Article 22 - No Strikes be discussed or processed by the University to the arbitration stage or heard by an arbitrator while such violation continues. This provision shall not, however, waive compliance with the time limits for filing grievances or appeals from decisions rendered with regard to grievances or appeals to the Arbitration Procedure. Any grievance settlements and arbitration awards regarding back pay and/or reinstatement of benefits for employees who engage in violations of Article 22 No Strikes shall not be made for any period of the time during which violations of Article 22 - No Strikes are occurring or have occurred.

ARTICLE 4 BENEFITS
A. GENERAL CONDITIONS
1. Eligible employees may participate in a number of benefit programs generally available to other eligible non-managerial, non-supervisory, non-confidential, non-academic employees of the University.

An eligible employee on military leave with pay for emergency National Guard duty or Military Reserve Training Leave shall receive those benefits related to employment that are granted in the University's Military Leave policy and its related documents.
3. Leaves Of Absence Without Pay

ARTICLE 5 CONTRACTING OUT
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Election is irrevocable. The University shall, offer severance in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights to all employees in the department who receive notice for indefinite layoff. Severance pay shall be in accordance with the following:
a. Payment - An employee who elects severance pay in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights shall be paid a lump sum as follows:
1) Employees with less than five (5) years of University service shall receive two (2) weeks severance pay.
2) Employees with five (5) or more years of University service shall receive five (5) weeks severance pay, plus one week for each additional year of service, up to a maximum of sixteen (16) weeks.
3) Employees who are laid off following a reduction in time that occurred within sixty (60) calendar days of the layoff shall be eligible for severance, on the basis of their percentage of appointment just prior to their reduction in time.
4) This Section shall not apply to temporary layoff or reduction in time.
5) Failure to make an election as provided in Section 1 will result in the employee receiving preferential rehire and recall rights and extinguish the right to severance pay.
b. Repayment - An employee who has received severance pay under this provision and who returns to work in a career position with the University at the same or higher salary and same percentage of time as the position held at the time of layoff shall repay to the University the portion of severance pay received that exceeds the time the employee was laid off. Before returning to work, the employee must make repayment in full or sign a repayment agreement.
H. CONTINUITY OF SERVICE UPON REEMPLOYMENT
A temporary layoff does not create a break in service. Reemployment in a career position within the period of right to recall provides continuity of service and continuation of previously-accrued seniority. However, seniority and benefits accrue only when an employee is on pay status.
I. BENEFIT COVERAGE
Medical plan contributions by the University will be provided for a maximum of three months in a calendar year for employees on temporary layoff, for employees on temporary reduction in time, or on furlough as provided in Article 29 - Positions, paragraph F.

a. Time Periods
1.) For Family Care and Medical Leave purposes only, twelve (12) workweeks means twelve (12) workweeks in any 12-month period for full-time employees. For employees who work less than full time or who work full time but on alternative work schedules, the number of working days shall be adjusted on a pro-rata basis. In the event University policy and/or applicable State or Federal law result in a different date of commencement for this 12-month period, the commencement period for employees in this bargaining unit shall conform to the commencement date generally applicable to other University employees.
2.) When medically necessary, and supported by medical certification, the University shall grant an employee Family Illness and/or Medical Leave on a reduced work schedule or on an intermittent basis including absences of less than one day. Only the time actually spent on the intermittent or reduced leave schedule shall be counted towards the employee's entitlement of twelve (12) workweeks in the leave year.
3.) When the employee requests an intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule for a planned medical treatment, the University may, at its discretion, require the employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternate position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position. Such transfer shall have equivalent pay and terms and conditions of employment, but does not need to have equivalent duties. Should the employee object to the temporary transfer, the employee may submit a written request for review to the Department/Division Head. Such temporary transfer shall not be subject to Article 9 Grievance Procedure or Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure.
b. Notice
1.) If the employee learns of the event giving rise to the need for leave more than thirty (30) days in advance, the employee shall provide the University with notice as soon as the employee learns of the need for leave, and, at a minimum, thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the leave, if practicable.
2.) If the need for leave is foreseeable due to a planned medical treatment or the supervision of a family member's medical treatment, the employee shall make reasonable efforts to schedule leaves so as to avoid disruption to the University's operations.
3.) If the need for leave is unforeseeable or actually occurs prior to the anticipated date of a foreseeable leave, the employee shall provide the University with as much advance notice as is practicable, and, at a minimum, with such notice within five working days after learning of the event.
4.) An employee who fails to give thirty (30) days' notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable basis for the delay, may have his/her family care and/or medical leave delayed until thirty (30) days after the date on which the employee provides notice.
5.) The University shall determine whether the employee is eligible and qualifies for a FMLA leave and shall notify the employee, in writing, when the leave is designated or provisionally designated as FMLA leave. The duration and terms of the leave and the date of return are determined when the leave is granted.
- 47 -
Extensions, if any, up to an aggregate of twelve (12) workweeks in the leave year may be granted in accordance with this Section.
c. Certification
1.) For the Employee's Own Serious Health Condition
a.) When leave is requested for the employee's own serious health condition, the University may, at its discretion, require that an employee's request for Family Illness or Medical Leave be supported by a written certification issued to the University by the employee's health care provider. Such request to the employee shall be in writing. The certification may be provided on a form given to the employee by the University and shall, regardless of the format, in addition to certifying that the employee has a serious health condition, include the following:
b.) A statement as to whether the employee is unable to perform any one of the essential assigned functions of the position including a statement of the function(s) the employee is unable to perform, and
c.) The date, if known, on which the serious health condition commenced, the probable duration of the condition and the probable date of return, and
d.) Whether it will be necessary for the employee to take leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule, and if so, the probable duration of such schedule, and,
e.) If the condition is chronic and the employee is presently incapacitated, the duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity.
2.) If Leave is Requested for the Employee's Family Member
When a leave of absence is requested for the serious health condition of the employee's family member, the University shall require that an employee's request for leave be supported by written certification issued by the family member's health care provider. When certification is required by the University, such requirement shall be submitted to the employee in writing. Certification may be provided by the employee on a form given to the employee by the University and shall, regardless of the format, in addition to certifying that the employee's family member has a serious health condition, include:
a.) A statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of the employee to provide supervision or care during a period of the treatment, or incapacity or psychological comfort, and
b.) Whether the employee's family member will need care intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule and the probable duration that the employee is needed to provide care.
c.) In addition, the employee will be required to certify either on the form or separately the care he/she will provide the family member and the estimated duration of the period of care.
- 48 -
3.) Should there be any questions regarding the validity of the employee's medical certification for his/her own serious health condition, the University may, at its discretion, require the employee to obtain a second medical opinion from a second health care provider jointly approved by the University and the employee. Should the second medical opinion differ from the employee's own health care provider, the University may require a third medical opinion from a third health care provider jointly approved by the University and the employee. The University shall bear the cost of the second and third opinions and the third opinion shall be final.
4.) If additional leave is requested upon expiration of the leave granted, or should the circumstances of the leave change, the University may, at its discretion, require the employee to obtain recertification. Such requests for subsequent certification shall be in writing.
5.) If certification or recertification is required, the employee shall return the certification within fifteen (15) calendar days of the University's request, where practicable. Failure to provide certification for a foreseeable leave within the requested time may result in the denial of the leave until the required certification is received. Failure to provide certification for an unforeseeable leave within the requested time period, may result in the denial of continuation of the leave until the required certification is provided. If the employee fails to provide a completed certification, the employee shall be given fifteen (15) calendar days to perfect the certification. Failure to perfect an incomplete certification may result in the denial of the leave or the denial of continuation of the leave. If the employee fails to provide a certification/recertification or a completed certification/ recertification and the leave has not begun, the request for family and/or medical leave will be denied. If the leave has begun, the leave may, at the University's discretion, be discontinued; however, any leave taken is not FMLA leave.
6.) An employee who has been granted a Medical Leave shall be returned to the same or an equivalent position when the employee has been medically released to perform the essential assigned functions of his/her job. Failure to provide a medical release to return to work may result in the denial of reinstatement until after the employee submits the required medical release certification.
d. Use of Accrued Paid Leave
1.) An employee on approved Family Illness Leave may elect to use accrued compensatory time off in accordance with Article 12 Hours of Work prior to beginning FMLA leave.

Furloughs are not to exceed a total of three (3) months in each calendar year.
D. PER DIEM APPOINTMENTS
1. Per diem appointments are established at any percentage of time regardless of the duration of the appointment.

A. The University will provide reasonable accommodation to qualified employees with disabilities, subject to defenses available under applicable law, when such disabilities limit their ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs. This Section shall not be construed as a guarantee of a specific form of accommodation nor shall accommodation in one case establish a precedent for similar or dissimilar circumstances, since all accommodations will be designed specific to the functional abilities of the employee in coordination with the requirements of the job.
B. After receipt of medical documentation from an employee with a disability, and after consultation with the employee, the University will determine what accommodations are necessary to allow the employee to perform his/her job. If the University determines it appropriate, the accommodation may extend to placement into a vacant position for which the employee is qualified without the requirement that the position be publicized.

If, while on vacation, an employee becomes ill and is under the care of a physician and submits a physician's statement, the employee may use accumulated sick leave for that personal illness. Sick leave may not be used for illness of a family member during the employee's vacation.
d. Bereavement Leave
Sick leave for bereavement purposes may be used as follows:
1) Up to five (5) days of accumulated sick leave per occurrence may be used when attendance is required due to the death of the employee's parent, spouse, or children, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchildren, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-inlaw, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or step-relatives; or any other person for whom the employee has a personal obligation who is residing in the employee's household.
2) In the event an employee has a personal obligation for a person other than someone in Section B.3.d.1 above, the employee shall be permitted to use up to five days of accrued sick leave per calendar year for funeral attendance/bereavement.
C. SICK LEAVE PAY
1. Sick leave is paid at the employee's straight time rate of pay including any shift differential, provided that the employee would have been expected to work that shift or shifts if not on sick leave.
2. No sick leave shall be payable to an employee unless the employee has complied fully with the terms of Section D, Sick Leave Notification and Verification.
D. SICK LEAVE NOTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION
1. Notice
a. To receive sick leave pay, an employee must notify his/her immediate supervisor or designee of the need for sick leave and the probable duration thereof as soon as possible, but in no event later than the beginning of the employee's work day except when the University determines that the employee's failure to notify is due to extreme circumstances beyond the control of the employee. Additionally, an employee must notify the University of the need to extend the sick leave prior to the anticipated date of return.
b. An employee shall request release from work in order to attend a prescheduled medical appointment, or a series of medical appointments, as soon as possible in advance of the appointment(s). The request shall specify the date(s) and time(s) of the appointment(s). Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.
c. Subsequent to a notice of illness/disability and the return to work by an employee, no time for which the employee has requested/received sick leave authorization shall be charged to accumulated/anticipated compensatory time, leave with pay, vacation, or holiday time in lieu of sick leave time.
2. Documentation and Verification
a. When it appears to be justified, an employee may be required to submit satisfactory documentation of personal illness or disability to the University in order to receive an excused absence from work and/or sick leave pay. The employee shall be given notice prior to returning to work that he/she will be required to provide such documentation.
- 79 -
b. Employees who have unscheduled absences due to illness on a scheduled work day preceding, on, or following a holiday may be required to bring a medical verification of illness to the employee's supervisor on the employee's return to work in order for the absence to be authorized.
c. When medical documentation is required by the University for a personal illness/disability absence it shall be from a health practitioner licensed by the state in which he/she practices to diagnose and certify illness or disability or from an authorized representative of a recognized treatment program. When an employee has been recommended for relief from duty by a medical practitioner acting on behalf of the University, the time granted shall be considered documented sick leave for the day of the relief from duty only, unless otherwise specified by the University's practitioner.
d. The University may have an employee claiming personal illness/disability examined by a physician or physicians of its choosing. The University shall pay the reasonable costs of any such medical examination and, when practical, shall send the employee to a physician of its choosing on the employee's work time.
e. An employee's repeated use of sick time may result in loss of sick leave pay, when the University has determined that such use is abusive, and provided the University has provided prior written notice to the employee that sick leave will be denied on future instances of illness irrespective of the nature or duration of illness. Additionally, an employee may not be eligible for sick leave pay in accordance with other provisions of this Article.
E. TRANSFER AND REINSTATEMENT OF SICK LEAVE
1. Transfer Without a Break in Service
An employee transferred, promoted, or demoted without a break in service shall have any accumulated sick leave transferred if the employee is moving to a position where sick leave is accumulated. An employee transferred, promoted, or demoted to a position which does not accumulate sick leave shall have his/her accumulated sick leave held in abeyance. If the employee subsequently moves without a break in service to a position within the University which does accumulate sick leave, the previously accumulated sick leave shall be restored. An employee who has been laid off and is recalled or preferentially rehired within the employee's period of recall or preferential rehire eligibility shall have all sick leave accumulated from prior service reinstated.
2. Reinstatement Upon Reemployment
An employee re-employed from University service or State of California service into the bargaining unit after a break in service of less than fifteen (15) calendar days shall have all sick leave accumulated from prior service reinstated if the new position is one which accumulates sick leave. If an employee is employed or re-employed in this bargaining unit after a break in service of more than fifteen (15) calendar days but less than six (6) months, sick leave accumulated from prior service up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours shall be reinstated. For purposes of this Section E.2 only, ""sick leave accumulated from prior service"" includes sick leave accumulated in State of California service.
3. Transfer to Position Not Covered by this Agreement
An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted into a position not covered by this Agreement shall have the accumulation, use, and transfer of sick leave governed by the policies and/or contract covering employees in that unit or personnel program.
- 80 -
F. ATTENDANCE STANDARDS
1. The University shall have the discretionary, non-grievable authority to establish, on a work location by work location basis, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and/or annual attendance standards. Employees who do not meet such standards shall be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.
2. The number of hours of sick leave generated per month or quadri-weekly cycle and/or the ability to or accomplishment of an employee accruing sick leave shall not have any bearing on the meeting of attendance standards.
3. At least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the implementation of new or changed attendance standards, the University shall inform AFSCME.
ARTICLE 37 STAFFING COMMITTEE
A. The Union and the University hereby agree to meet every other month at each medical center location to address staffing issues and to try to develop reasonable workload guidelines. The parties may agree to meet more or less often. Campus location means all work units associated with a campus, including those at off-campus sites. Such meetings will occur in accordance with the following:
1. The Union must request a meeting and the parties must agree to the meeting date.
2. The Union must submit a written agenda identifying staffing concerns it wishes to discuss. Such agenda must be submitted to the designated campus representative at least ten (10) work days before the proposed meeting date.
3. In the event the University has agenda items regarding staffing, the University shall present its agenda to the Union at least ten (10) work days before the scheduled meeting.
4. In the event neither party submits an agenda item ten (10) work days before the scheduled meeting, the meeting will not be convened.
5. Individuals who can effectively address the staffing issues that are identified in the submitted agenda will represent each party at the meeting
6. The staffing committee will be made up of no more than four (4) Union representatives and four (4) management representatives. Additional individuals may attend by written agreement of the parties. The Union must submit a written request for employee release time at least seven (7) work days before the scheduled meeting. Such employees will be counted as union representatives, and the release time shall be granted unless operational requirements determine otherwise. Permission to attend these meetings shall not be unreasonably denied.
7. The Union may present staffing concerns and propose solutions at the staffing committee meetings.
8. The parties may use the meetings to discuss the issues pertaining to custodial workload, with the square footage conversion table referenced in the Side Letter of September 26, 2001, as one consideration in the discussions. The University recognizes that custodial work may be performed by individuals in classifications other than ""custodian"" at some campuses/hospitals/laboratories.
- 81 -
Other considerations will include, but not be limited to, factors such as the type of area to be cleaned, (e.g., classrooms, medical facilities, washrooms, laboratories; areas with easily removable seating vs. areas with fixed equipment/furniture), the scope of routine cleaning activities, (e.g., waste removal, sweeping, dusting, etc.), the scope of special cleaning project activities, (e.g., stripping/waxing/buffing floors, refinishing surfaces, etc.), the combination of areas to be cleaned (e.g., classrooms and washrooms), the type of cleaning expected, the expected cleaning results and how often specific cleaning expectations are performed (e.g., trash emptied daily/weekly), the number of employees assigned to the work. Other relevant work related factors not mentioned herein may also be considered by the parties.
B. The union may request relevant and necessary information as soon as practicable before the proposed meeting date. The University will provide relevant and necessary information about staffing issues at least forty-eight (48) hours before the meeting, provided the requested information can be reasonably gathered in time to provide it within two working days before the meeting. If the information cannot be provided by forty-eight (48) hours before the meeting, the University will notify the union as soon as practicable. The meeting date may be postponed for a reasonable period. The Union agrees not to make unduly burdensome information requests.
C. The University retains the sole prerogative to make decisions about staffing. The union retains the right to bargain over the effects of the University's staffing decisions.
1. The union agrees to identify the known effects of the staffing change it wishes to bargain at the time it makes the bargaining request. During the course of negotiations, the union can raise additional effects issues as they become known.
2. The University shall negotiate over the effects identified by the union, insofar as they are the mandatory subjects of bargaining: wages, hours, and terms & conditions of employment.
D. The University's failure to comply with the procedural requirements in this Article is grievable and arbitrable. However, the University's staffing decisions are not grievable or arbitrable, nor is the modification of a staffing decision a remedy that an arbitrator can award.
--
e. Among equally qualified non-probationary career applicants for promotion or transfer, seniority will be considered as a tie-breaker. The use of seniority as a tie-breaker determination is non-grievable and nonarbitrable.
f. If, in the evaluation of the department head, two or more applicants are substantially equally qualified, the department head shall make the determination taking into consideration Article 5 - Contracting Out, Sections B.1 and B.3, relative to the University maintaining its Federal Contractor Status. The University shall give consideration to providing transfer and promotion opportunities for career employees. In considering an employee for transfer and promotion, the University shall consider the employee's University work performance and experience. The next consideration shall be to provide transfer and promotion opportunities for career employees. If the department head determines that more than one current career University employee is qualified, the department head shall consider each employee's performance and length of University service. In those cases where the department head determines that qualifications of an applicant who is currently a University employee and qualifications of an external candidate are essentially equal, the department head shall reconsider the credentials (including but not limited to, the resume, application, a written recommendation from the employee's supervisor, and/or interview responses, if any) of the University employee applicant(s).
g. A non-probationary career employee who was interviewed for a promotion within the bargaining unit and was not selected may request, in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of notification, an explanation of the reason for non-selection.
- 83 -
The department head or designee, shall provide a written response within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the employee's written request.
h. In addition, the University shall consider qualified employees who are eligible for reemployment in accordance with Section C of Article 31 Reasonable Accommodation and Section F of Article 17 - Medical Separation of this Agreement.
2. Employees who are scheduled for a job interview at the same location as the employee's current position shall be granted reasonable time off with pay, as determined by the University, if the interview has been scheduled during the employee's normal work hours. An employee scheduled for an interview on another campus/Laboratory shall be granted reasonable time off with pay for an amount of time normally equal to the time that would be required for an interview on the employee's own campus/Laboratory.
3. Upon upward reclassification, an employee shall be granted a salary increase to the minimum of the salary range of the new class or one (1) step [4% for nonstep based employees] whichever is greater, provided that the new rate does not exceed the maximum of the new class.
4. The University shall provide AFSCME the following information:
a. The number and classifications of bargaining unit positions posted which were restricted to current University employees;
b. The number and classification of bargaining unit positions where an employee was promoted and received more than one (1) step increase; and
c. The number and classification of bargaining unit positions posted.
This information shall be made available annually for the period of April 1st through March 30th and provided to the Union during the month of May. The format of the above information shall be on a location-by-location basis.
5. In accordance with campus/Laboratory practice, the University shall inform employees of career development and/or training programs which might assist them with transfers and/or promotions.
6. Decisions or actions taken or not taken with regard to transfer and promotion are not subject to Article 9 - Grievance Procedure or Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 39 TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT
The following per diem rates are to be used to reimburse employees for subsistence expenses when actual, itemized expenses are not claimed. The dollar amounts assigned to each component are shown for calculation of per diem for travel of twentyfour (24) hours or less and for adjustments required when subsistence expense is paid directly by the University.
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidentals, per diem total = $37.00; lodging by receipt.
Mileage for privately-owned automobiles (including vans) = $.24/per mile.
A. University-approved out-of-state lodging expenses will be reimbursed based on the expenses actually incurred as supported by receipts provided prior approval has been received. Other travel expenses shall remain subject to the per diem rate set forth above regardless of where the expenses were incurred.
B. When subsistence expense is paid directly by the University, the individual employee's per diem will be reduced accordingly.
- 84 -
C. Changes in per diem rates which are uniformly implemented for non-represented staff employees shall be implemented for the employees covered by this Agreement.
PER DIEM RATES -- LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY
Policies, procedures, definitions, qualifications, calculations, covered hours and rates relative to Per Diem Rates at the Laboratory shall remain in effect for employees at the Laboratory and where in conflict shall supersede the provisions of this Article in Section A above.
ARTICLE 40 UNIFORMS
A. UNIFORMS
Uniforms are attire which are required by the University to be worn in the performance of assigned duties. The University shall have the sole discretion to determine who shall wear a uniform and the conditions under which it must be worn. When a uniform is required by the University an employee shall be responsible, at the time of employment, for the purchase of uniform components specified by the University. Employees shall wear the uniform and maintain a proper appearance as specified by the University.
B. UNIFORM CHANGE TIME
When an employee is required to change into or out of uniform at the work site, a maximum of ten minutes shall be allowed for this purpose after the beginning and prior to the end of the work shift. Employees not required to change into or out of uniform at the work site will not be granted uniform change time.
C. UNIFORM ALLOWANCE/LAUNDERING
1. Where the University currently provides a uniform allowance, the allowance will continue at the current rate. Where the University currently provides uniforms, the University will continue to provide them as long as the University continues its requirement that uniforms be worn.
2. Where laundering of uniforms is currently provided by the University, such laundering shall continue while the requirement for uniforms continues.
ARTICLE 41 VACATION LEAVE
A. VACATION CREDIT
1 . Until a campus implements the following Factor Accrual System, current accrual practices will remain in place.
2. After a campus implements the following Factor Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn vacation credit each month or quadri-weekly cycle based on the number of hours on pay status for that month or quadri-weekly cycle at the following rates:
Years of Qualifying Service Less than 10 10 but less than 15 15 but less than 20 20 or more
Per Hour on Pay Status* .057692 .069231 080769 .092308
Approximate Yearly Earning** 15 days 18 days 21 days 24 days
Maximum Accumulated Balance 240 hours 288 hours 336 hours 384 hours
*Hours on pay status, including paid holiday hours, but excluding all paid overtime hours. ** Full-time rate.
- 85 -
3. For campuses retaining the Table Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn vacation credit (Appendix B) each month based on the number of hours on pay status for that month at the following rates:
a. Ten (10) hours per month for a full-time employee with less than ten (10) years of qualifying service;
b. Twelve (12) hours per month for a full-time employee with at least ten (10) but less than fifteen (15) years of qualifying service;
c. Fourteen (14) hours per month for a full-time employee with at least fifteen (15) but less than twenty (20) years of qualifying service; and
d. Sixteen (16) hours per month for a full-time employee with twenty (20) years or more of qualifying service.
4. A month of service at one-half (1/2) time or more is a month of qualifying service.
5. An employee must be on pay status for a least one-half (1/2) of the working hours of a month or quadri-weekly cycle to earn vacation credit for that month or quadri-weekly cycle. Vacation credit is earned proportionately for hours on pay status over one-half (1/2) of the full-time working hours of the month or quadriweekly cycle but less than full-time. Time on pay status in excess of a full-time employee's work schedule does not earn vacation credit.
6. Earned vacation for each month or quadri-weekly cycle is credited on the first day of the following month or quadri-weekly cycle, except that proportionate vacation credit for an eligible employee who is separating from employment shall be credited at the completion of the last day on pay status. A full-time employee on the Factor Accrual System may earn vacation credit to a maximum stated in Section A.1. above. A full-time employee on the Table Accrual System may earn vacation credit to a maximum of two (2) times the employee's annual accumulation rate. A part-time employee may earn vacation credit to the same maximum number of hours as a full-time employee with comparable years of service.
B. VACATION CREDIT USE
Vacation leave is scheduled at the convenience of the University. An employee appointed at fifty percent (50%) or more of full-time for a period of six (6) months or more is eligible to earn vacation credit from the date of hire; however, an employee may not use vacation credit until after six (6) continuous months on pay status. No vacation shall be used prior to the time it is credited.
C. VACATION SCHEDULING
1. An employee may request vacation, and the University will consider such request when establishing or modifying vacation schedules. Vacation schedules are established in accordance with normal scheduling practices and in accordance with the needs of the University. The University will respond to an employee's vacation request as soon as practicable after such request is made by the employee but is not required to respond to an employee's request prior to the establishment of a vacation schedule. Once established, the University will endeavor to adhere to the vacation schedule. When during the review of simultaneous requests for vacation submitted by more than one employee, operational needs do not permit the granting of requests for vacation at the same time for the employees who have requested that specific time period, preference in granting the request shall be based on the respective seniority of the employees. Where a practice of rotation of vacation periods exists, such practices shall continue, and only operational needs will be used in assigning such vacation.
2. The University will endeavor to respond to the employee's additional vacation request(s) within ten (10) calendar days of his/her request for use of vacation.
- 86 -
D. VACATION MAXIMUMS
1. Employees shall be made aware of their vacation accruals on at least a monthly basis. Upon implementation of the University's automated accrual system, the University shall provide employees with at least sixty (60) calendar days notification that he/she will reach the maximum allowable accumulation.
2. The employee shall request dates for use of the vacation as soon as possible prior to the maximum accumulation. When the request is provided at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance, an employee shall be granted vacation before the employee's accumulated credit reaches the maximum, with the following exceptions:
a. If the specific dates on which the employee requests use of vacation credit cannot be granted, the employee shall be scheduled for alternate dates off; or
b. In the event the University cannot schedule alternate dates off, the vacation credit in excess of the employee's maximum allowable accumulation which cannot be used shall be placed in the employee's compensatory time bank and shall become compensatory time off credit.
3. In the event an employee fails to request use of vacation credit at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to reaching his/her vacation maximum, the University shall endeavor to grant the vacation use requested or schedule an alternate date.
If such request cannot be granted or an alternate date cannot be scheduled, and if the employee had been notified at least sixty (60) calendar days in advance that he/she was reaching the maximum vacation allowable, the vacation credit which would have taken the employee over his/her vacation credit maximum shall be lost to the employee.
E. VACATION PAY
1. Pay for vacation shall be at the employee's straight time rate including any shift differential, provided that the employee would have been expected to work that shift or shifts if not on vacation.
2. An employee who separates from employment or who is granted extended military leave shall be paid for any vacation earned through the employee's last day of work, except that an employee who is retiring may use vacation up to the effective date of retirement.
F. TRANSFER OF VACATION CREDIT
An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to another University position in which vacation credit can be earned shall have any earned vacation credit transferred unless such transfer is in conflict with an Agreement covering the new position. An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to a University position for which a transfer of credit is in conflict with an Agreement or in which vacation credit is not earned shall be paid for any earned vacation at the time of transfer. An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to a Laboratory (LBL) position from a campus or from a LBL position to a campus position shall be paid for any earned vacation at the time of transfer.
G. CURTAILMENT PERIOD
1. Consistent with the University's management rights, including its right to determine the orderly, effective and efficient operation of the University, the University may elect at one or more of its locations, to curtail or shut down some or all of its activities, on a location by location basis, for periods of specific duration.
- 87 -
By way of example and not limitation, such periods may represent opportunities for energy/cost savings and/or adjustments to reduce levels of work activity due to transition periods in the academic calendar and/or ""seasonal"" or ""holiday"" influences on scheduled work activities and/or the occurrence at or on University facilities of major public events and/or the occurrence of emergency or ""forces of nature"" situations adversely affecting normal University operations.
2. In the event of such total or partial closure or curtailment of operations, whether or not the University is able to anticipate such event, employees affected shall select one or a combination of the following options to cover their status during such period of time:
a. Employees may use accumulated vacation leave during the period. Newly employed unit members would be allowed to use accrued vacation even if the required six (6) continuous months on pay status has not been completed. Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation would be allowed to use up to three (3) days vacation leave prior to actual accrual.
b. Employees with accrued compensatory time may elect to use it to cover the scheduled time off or to offset the use of vacation time.
c. Employees who do not wish to use vacation or compensatory time off may elect to take a leave without pay during the closure.
d. Employees who do not select from a, b or c above or who do not qualify for a, b, or c above shall, for the period of time necessary, be placed in a leave without pay status.

C. PAY EQUITIES
1 . The provisions of this section will take place effective January 28, 2002.
2. The University of California supports reasonable pay rate equity (within 5%), resulting from the University's initially hiring new career employees at a rate of pay at least 5% higher than the pay of current career employees in the same hiring unit in the same classification and who are assigned the same duties. For the purposes of this Section, a hiring unit is equivalent to a layoff unit. When examining reasonable equity rate issues, the University and AFSCME shall consider the employees':

All criteria must be met to invoke the University's obligation to increase wages to within 5% of a new hire with a higher salary.
4. The University will provide AFSCME with a list of each campus', hospital's, and the LBNL's current layoff units. The lists will be provided to AFSCME by January 31, 2002.
5. An equity rate adjustment concern does not include salary actions/agreements for employees who are entering a hiring unit from other University facilities/units, preferential rehire, or rehire from rehabilitation or disability.
- 89 -
D. PAY RATE EQUITY ADJUSTMENTS PROCESS
1. Grievability and Arbitrability

b. At all steps of the grievance and arbitration procedure, the remedy is limited to whether the University properly applied the criteria in Section C. 2. The arbitrator shall have no authority to set individual wage rates that are less than 5% different from the wages of the comparator new employee.
2. Normal Procedure for adjusting pay equities existing from January 28, 2002
Affected employees and/or AFSCME may file a grievance regarding a pay equity concern in accordance with Section C.2, above. Pay rate adjustments shall, if any, be effective on the first day of the first pay period following receipt of the grievance.
E. SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL RATE CHANGES
1. Shift differential rates are found in Appendix A. It is the intent of the parties that employees who are assigned to the second or third shift will receive a shift differential, unless such a shift differential is built into their base salary.
2. Shift differential rates will be included in wage negotiations.
3. On call employees who are called into work during the evening or night shift shall be paid the applicable shift differential allocated to the title for all hours the employee actually worked during the shift(s) provided he/she works four (4) or more hours in that shift.
F. The range and rate adjustments, base or non-base, if any, provided in this Article shall not be subject to Article 9 - Grievance Procedure, or Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure, of this Agreement, with the exception of range and rate adjustment provided pursuant to Section D of this Article.
ARTICLE 43 WAIVER
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of the right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. The rights and procedures granted and set forth under Staff Personnel Policy will no longer apply to employees covered by this Agreement. The University and AFSCME, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to, or covered in this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
ARTICLE 44 WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS
1. An employee who is unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act is eligible to use sick leave, extended sick leave, and vacation leave as provided below.

--
a. The University shall inform the employee that a medical release to return is required as soon as practicable after the need for such documentation is determined; and
b. The employee shall provide the University with the required medical release as soon as possible after the medical release is available to the employee. When possible, the employee shall provide such documentation thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated date of return; and
c. Such medical documentation may be subject to confirmation by a University-appointed physician.
3. If the position held by the employee at the time the leave was granted has been abolished during the leave, the employee shall be afforded the same consideration which would have been afforded had the employee been on pay status when the position was abolished.
- 92 -
F. SEPARATION
An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay. Any vacation credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.
ARTICLE 45 WORK RULES
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. The University has the sole, non-grievable, non-arbitrable right to promulgate, supplement, alter, modify, amend, and rescind, work rules. For the purposes of this Article, work rules are defined as rules promulgated by the University which regulate employees relative to and affecting their employment.

The Employer and MOSES agree not to discriminate in any way against employees covered by this Agreement on account of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical handicap, or veteran status.
Section 6.2
MOSES and the Employer agree that when the effects of employment practices, regardless of their intent, discriminate against any group of people on the basis of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, mental or physical handicap, specific positive and aggressive measures must be taken to redress the effects of past discrimination, to eliminate present and future discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of hiring, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rate of compensation, and in-service or apprenticeship training programs. Therefore the parties acknowledge the need for positive and aggressive affirmative action.
Section 6.3
The Statewide MOSES/Management Committee established pursuant to Article 26 shall give priority to the area of affirmative action.

Section 6.7
The Employer shall not interfere with MOSES' legal rights to self operation, nor shall any officer or representative of MOSES be prevented from serving in his/her capacity under the law.
ARTICLE 7 WORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES
Section 7.l
Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday
A. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for full-time employees shall be thirty-seven and one half hours per week excluding meal periods or forty hours per week excluding meal periods, as has been established for that job title at the particular job location. Any employee whose regular workweek has averaged more than forty hours excluding meal periods in the past shall have a forty hour workweek.
B. The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and MOSES stewards.
C. When the Employer desires to change the work schedule of an employee he shall give the affected employee at least ten days' written notice of such contemplated change, except in cases of emergency involving the protection of the property of the Commonwealth or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the Commonwealth. However, a
12
declaration of emergency shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime.
D. To the extent practicable, the normal workweek shall consist of five consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable employees in continuous operations shall receive two consecutive days off in each seven-day period. This subsection should not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours programs.
E. The parties acknowledge the benefit of establishing alternative work schedules, including but not limited to flexible hours, staggered hours, part-time and job sharing where such programs contribute to the efficient delivery of state services. The MOSES/Management Committee established pursuant to Article 26 of this Agreement shall meet to determine the feasibility of establishing such options where they do not currently exist, to monitor existing programs, and to recommend changes where appropriate. Upon the written request of either party, MOSES shall meet with local and central office representatives relative to developing and implementing flextime/alternative-work schedules where feasible for an individual worksite/facility or for the department/agency. Following said meetings where there continues to be any unresolved issues the areas of dispute may be brought at the request of either party to the Human Resources Division to work toward a possible resolution. All agreements reached pursuant to the above paragraph shall be submitted to MOSES and the Human Resources Division for approval.
Section 7.2
Overtime
A. Overtime shall be voluntary except in an emergency. There shall be no discrimination or discipline taken against any employee who declines to work overtime in a non emergency situation.
--
D. The Employer shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, curtail the scheduled hours of an employee during the remainder of a workweek in which the employee has previously worked hours beyond his/her normally scheduled workday. This paragraph shall not apply to employees who, because of the nature of the duties of their positions, work an irregular workday, nor shall it apply to employees who have been permitted by the Employer to participate in an approved voluntary flexible hours program that has been duly authorized by the appointing authority and by the Personnel Administrator.
Where operations such as hazardous waste spill cleanup, medical emergency, safety control, bituminous concrete placement, cement concrete placement, steel erection or other critical operations that require continuous monitoring requiring an employee to work through his/her lunch period, he/she shall be granted compensatory time at the rate of one and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for the lunch period work.
E. With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on full pay status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation. However, paid sick leave used by an employee during the same work week in which he/she is required to work overtime because of an emergency shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation for that work week, provided that nothing herein shall interfere with the Employer's right to request satisfactory medical evidence under the terms of Article 8, Section 8.1(K).
F. There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of the premium pay for overtime work provided for in this Agreement.
G. The Employer shall make every effort to send out checks for overtime no later than the second payroll period following the payroll period of the overtime worked.
H. Overtime shall be distributed as equitably and impartially as practicable among persons in each work location who ordinarily perform such related work in the normal course of their workweek to meet the operational needs of each department/agency at each work location. Department heads and MOSES representatives at each location shall work out procedures for implementing this policy of distributing overtime work.
I. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to employees on full travel status to the extent permitted by law.
J. Upon the request of an employee, an appointing authority may grant at its discretion compensatory time in lieu of payment for overtime at a rate not less than one
13
and one-half hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation would be required under this Article. Such compensatory time shall not be accumulated in excess of one hundred and twenty hours and may be used in one half-hour increments. An appointing authority shall permit the use of compensatory time at the employee's request, provided the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operation of a department or agency. Upon termination an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the final regular rate of pay.

If an employee has exhausted his/her personal leave by January 1 , 2000, and said employee requires the use of personal leave before said implementation of HR/CMS, the Employer agrees to allow an employee to "" draw"" against their personal leave balance in advance of said implementation.
An employee's unused but forfe itable vacation time as of June 30, 2000 will not be forfeited as required by Article 9; rather said forfeiture shall not occur until December 31, 2000.

Employees whose conduct does not conform to the rules and guidelines contained in this Code may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any disciplinary action taken will conform to civil service law and/or the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
5. Distribution of Code
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will see that each employee receives a copy of this Code. Employees will acknowledge receipt of the Code by signing the attached Receipt of Code Form (Form CC-3) in the space provided. In each instance, the signed Receipt Form will be returned to the employee' s appointing authority or his/her designee within ten days of receipt, and filed in the employee's personnel folder. The employee' s signature on the Receipt Form is notice of his/her obligation to familiarize himself/herself with the contents of the Code of Conduct and to abide by it.
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will be responsible for providing accurate information and guidance to his/her employees with regard to the specifics of the Code and may from time to time offer training sessions on the Code to his/her employees as the need arises.
108
6. Effective Date of Code
The effective date of the Code shall be ten days after the Code of Conduct is distributed and the Code of Conduct Receipt Form is received by the employee.
B. Conformance to Laws
Employees shall obey the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any employee who is convicted of a crime relating to his/her employment shall be subject to discipline.
Any employee who has been indicted or arrested for a serious crime, supported by a judicial finding of probable cause in a preliminary hearing when the nature of the charge with its attendant publicity reasonably gives rise to legitimate fear for the safety of other employees, the property of the Commonwealth, or jeopardizes the public trust in the ethical standards of agency/departmental employees or undermines the trust in the integrity of the Commonwealth's system of tax administration or the administration of other laws of the Commonwealth, may also be subject to suspension without pay or other employee benefits, pending resolution of the case.
If the employee is found not guilty, pleads nolo contendere, has his/her case continued without a finding, is granted immunity from prosecution or has his/her case filed, further disciplinary action, including termination, may be taken if the crime was related to his/her employment. If the employee is found not guilty, or the case is nolle prosequi or dismissed, the employee shall be immediately reinstated to employment retroactive to the date of suspension without loss of wages or other employee benefits.
C. Conformance to Policies, Procedures and Directives
Employees shall comply with all of the policies and operating procedures of the agency/department in which they work. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, all agency/departmental policies and procedures. Employees shall respond forthrightly and promptly to the work-related directives of their supervisors.
D. Conduct, Attitude and Demeanor
Employees are expected to conduct themselves in their official relations with the public and with their fellow employees in a manner which will enhance public respect for, and confidence in, the employee and in the Commonwealth as a whole. They must not only perform their duties in a wholly impartial manner, but must avoid any conduct which gives
109
the reasonable basis for the impression of acting otherwise.
Specifically, all employees shall avoid any action which may result in or create the reasonable basis for the impression of:
a. using public office for private gain;
b. giving preferential treatment to any citizen;
c. making work-related decisions contrary to agency/departmental policy;
d. using one's official position to harass or intimidate any person or entity outside the course of official duties.
E. Administrative Inquiries
Employees must respond promptly and fully to all administrative inquiries when directed to do so.
F. State Ethics Commission Financial Disclosure Requirements
Employees who are required to file a ""Statement of Financial Disclosure"" with the State Ethics Commission, under the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 268B, shall do so in a timely manner as prescribed by the State Ethics Commission. The State Ethics Commission will notify each employee who is required to file such a statement.
5. CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The Necessity For The Fair And Impartial Administration Of State Government And The Enforcement Of Its Laws Makes The Avoidance Of Any Conflict Of Interest Of Primary Importance. A Conflict Of Interest Is A Situation In Which An Employee's Private Interest, Usually Financial, Conflicts Or Raises A Reasonable Question Of Conflict With His/Her Official Duties And Responsibilities.
Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Provides Criminal And Civil Penalties For Conflict Of Interest Violations. The Following Three General Categories Of Prohibitions Are To Be Used As Guidelines For Your Information. (Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Offers Specific Details).
1. No employee may request or receive, in any manner whatsoever, compensation or anything else of value, except from the Commonwealth: (a) for performance of his/her duties; or (b) for influencing or appearing to influence such performance.
2. No employee may participate in any official action relating to any entity in which the employee or a member of his/her immediate family has a financial interest.
110
3. No employee may participate in any official action relating to any individual with whom or entity in which the employee has a substantial personal interest.
Employees have an obligation to avoid scrupulously the potential conflicts of interest which exist in their employment. They have a duty to disclose and report promptly the existence or possible existence of a conflict of interest to their agency head or his/her designee. They should request from their supervisor the transfer from their caseload of any case which involves their immediate family, close friend or any person with whom or entity in which they have some personal or financial involvement.
In addition, they have a right under law to have any question relating to a possible conflict of interest confidentially reviewed and decided by the State Ethics Commission. Information regarding the filing of a conflict of interest request with the State Ethics Commission is available from the agency head or his/her designee or from the Ethics Commission directly.
In addition to the sanctions referred to above, M.G.L. Ch. 268A, Section 23 also prescribes and describes certain "" Standards of Conduct"". Violations of these standards are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. All employees are required to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of these standards, which provide as follows:
""No current officer or employee of a state, county, or municipal agency shall:
(1) accept other employment which will impair his independence of judgement in the exercise of his official duties;
(2) use or attempt to use his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others;
(3) by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly influence or unduly enjoy his favor in the performance of his official duties, or that he is unduly affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person.""
""No current or former officer or employee of a state, county or municipal agency shall:
(1) accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information which he has gained by reason of his official position or authority;
(2) improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by Section Seven of Chapter Four of the General Laws, and were acquired by him in the course of his official duties nor use such information to further his personal interests."" (See M.G.L. Ch. 268A, S. 23).
Ill
These rules with respect to conflicts of interest are in addition to, and supplement, state policies and agency/departmental rules, regulations and operating procedures that may otherwise apply to the official actions of employees.
(In the event that the appointing authority, or his/her designee, approves a particular activity and the Ethics Commission subsequently determines that such activity is a conflict of interest, the appointing authority will not discipline the employee for such activity. However, only the Ethics Commission, and formerly the Attorney General, have the authority to issue an opinion interpreting M.G.L. Chapter 268A, which is binding.)
6. GIFTS AND GRATUITIES FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES
A. General Limitations
Employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who or entity which, the employee knows or has reason to know:
(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with his/her agency/department;
(2) Conducts business or other activities which are regulated or monitored by the agency/department, except as permitted by this section or by agency/departmental directives; or
(3) Has interests that may be or give the reasonable impression of being substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee' s official duties.
B. Exceptions
The restrictions set forth in paragraph A of this section do not apply to:
(1) Obvious family or personal relations when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships, rather than the business or the persons concerned, are the motivating factors behind any gift or gratuity.
(2) The acceptance of food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a breakfast, luncheon, dinner or other meetings attended for educational, informational or other similar purposes. However, agency/departmental employees are specifically prohibited from accepting free food or other gratuity except non-alcoholic beverages (coffee, tea, etc.), while on official business, from persons with whom they have contact in the performance of their official duties.
112
(3) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans, automobile loans, personal loans, etc., provided that the employee does not deal with that institution in the course of his/her official duties. However, if dealing with such banks or financial institutions is unavoidable, the employee must disclose dealings to the appropriate authority in writing prior to engaging in such dealings.
(4) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars, and other items of nominal value.
(5) The acceptance of an award or gift of nominal value for a speech, participation in a conference, or some public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, if such organization falls within paragraph A above.
(6) Acceptance of reimbursement, in cash or in kind, for travel, subsistence and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, provided such attendance and reimbursement is approved by the appointing authority or his/her designee. Such reimbursement can be made directly to the employee. An employee on official business may not be reimbursed, and payment may not be made on his/her behalf, for excessive (e.g., reimbursement which exceeds actual cost) personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, travel or other benefits. At no time shall an employee accept reimbursement from both the Commonwealth and another source for the same expenses.
7. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
A. Introduction: Principles
The Commonwealth seeks to give employees the maximum freedom possible to engage in outside employment or business activities consistent with the Commonwealth' s responsibilities. However, the extremely sensitive mission of the Commonwealth and its employees necessitates certain restrictions. Employees may engage in outside employment or business activity provided such activity is not prohibited by this Code or by any statute, regulation or departmental order.
An activity that is permissible for the occupant of one position may very well not be permissible for the occupant of another position. Therefore, in considering each case on its individual merits, the employee must satisfy the following principles:
113
(1) The outside activity would not place the employee in a situation where there is a conflict, or in a situation which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict, between his or her private interests and his or her official duties and responsibilities (see section 5, above, ""Conflict of Interest"", for additional guidance).
(2) The outside activity would not result in use, dissemination or disclosure to others of confidential information obtained in connection with the employee's departmental duties or position.
(3) The nature of the employment or business activity or the hours to be devoted to such activity would not impair the employee's availability, capacity or efficiency for the performance of his/her official duties as an employee of the Commonwealth.
(4) Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through their employment. In particular, they shall not use confidential information obtained in the course of their employment with the Commonwealth to obtain benefits, financial or otherwise, for themselves, their families or others.
B. Activities Which Do Not Require Prior Notice
(1) Introduction
Employees are generally not required to submit written notice before engaging in outside activities which are not considered to be employment or business related. Although it is not feasible to cover every specific activity of this nature, the general categories discussed below are furnished as basic guidelines.
(2) General Examples
(a) Membership and uncompensated services (including holding of office) in civic, scout, religious, educational, fraternal, social, community, veterans, or charitable organizations.
(b) Services as a notary public or justice of the peace.
(c) Rental of employee-owned property, real or personal, to the extent such property is not rented to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any agency or subdivision thereof, or the lessee is not a subject of the employee' s official duties.
114
(d) Minor services and odd jobs for friends, relatives, or neighbors. These include a wide variety of activities, including: repair or maintenance work such as painting, yard work, carpentry, or services such as babysitting and carpools involving payment for transportation.
(e) Temporary (thirty days or less) assistance in a family enterprise, in the event of an emergency, such as the death or serious illness/accident to a member of the family engaged in that business.
(f) However, no employee shall without appropriate disclaimer stating that the employee does not speak for the agency/ department, take an active part or become an advocate on behalf of a professional society in any conflict between such society and the agency/department.
C. Specific Prohibitions and Restrictions on Employment
(1) Outside Legal or Accounting Practice or Employment
(a) General Prohibitions
No outside legal or accounting practice is permitted which is in violation of M.G.L. Ch. 268A. Specifically, employees are prohibited from receiving compensation from or acting as agent or attorney for anyone other than the Commonwealth in relation to any particular matter in which the Commonwealth or a state agency is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.
To the extent that outside legal or accounting practice is permitted, it must not interfere with the effective performance of an employee' s official duties.
8. DUTY TO REPORT VIOIATIONS OF LAW AND CODE OF CONDUCT
A. Generally
Every employee is expected to maintain and uphold the integrity of the Department. In satisfying this requirement, it shall be the duty of every employee to report promptly and accurately violations of law that affect the administration of the Department or the laws of the Commonwealth to his/her agency/department head or designee. To the fullest extent possible, any such reports will be treated confidentially.
115
B. Attempts to Bribe
Bribery and attempted bribery are claims which strike at the core of state government. Employees should be constantly alert to solicitations to accept money, consideration, or anything of value in return for acts or omissions involving their official functions. Such solicitations may be indirect and subtle. Any attempt to bribe a departmental employee shall be reported immediately to the proper agency authority.
9. OTHER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
A.
False Statement

C. Public Records
All requests for public records should be directed to the appointing authority or his/her designee, who shall determine whether the requested documents are public records in accordance with M.G.L. c. 4, Sec. 7, C1. 26.
D. Drugs and Alcohol
While on duty no employee shall consume or use alcohol, intoxicants, narcotics, or controlled substances in any form. Similarly, no employee shall report for work under the influence of intoxicants, narcotics or controlled substances in any form. The only exception to this rule is the use of medication when prescribed for the treatment of the employee by a registered physician or dentist.
E. Departmental Identification Cards, Badges, Etc.
Agency/Departmental identification cards, badges and other identification or access cards or documents are for use only in establishing identity, authority or access in connection with official duties.
116
Agency/departmental identification cards or badges may be used for personal identification purposes when cashing checks or as proof of employment, such as when applying for a loan, for credit or when renting an apartment.
Employees are responsible for the safeguarding and proper use of agency/departmental identification cards, badges and access cards, for promptly reporting their loss and for surrendering them on termination of employment or demand by proper agency/departmental authorities.
Cards, badges or documents, or an employee' s official position or status, are not to be used to exert influence or obtain, either directly or indirectly, personal privileges, favors or rewards for themselves or others. Photo identification badges must be worn while at work in any agency which requires them to be worn.
F. Political Activities
Employees are prohibited from using their offices or official duties to interfere with, affect or influence the results of a nomination or election for public office.

No employee shall solicit or accept funds or anything of value for any party, political committee, agency, person or organization for political purposes.
Employees are not prohibited from contributing to the campaign committee or organization for nomination or election of any individual running for public office or to any committee, agency, or organization for political purposes.
Employees are prohibited from campaigning for political office for themselves or others during normal working hours. Employees are prohibited from being a candidate for federal, state or full-time municipal office while on active duty. Such employees must obtain a leave of absence to run for such offices.
Employees are prohibited from wearing a political or campaign button while on official agency/departmental business.
Employees shall abide by the provisions of the following paragraph from M.G.L. Ch. 268A, Section 11 which provides:
"" This section shall not prohibit a state or county employee from holding an elective or appointive office in a city, town or district nor in any way prohibit such an employee from performing the duties of or receiving the compensation provided for such office. No such elected or appointed official may vote or act on any matter which is within the purview of the agency by which he/she is
117
employed or over which such employee has official responsibility."" G. Testimonial Dinners Employees are prohibited from selling or accepting payment for tickets, admissions or contributions, for a testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a purpose similar to a testimonial dinner or function held on behalf of any employee of his/her agency/department. No employee shall participate in or accept contributions for or from any testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a similar purpose, held on his/her behalf while he/she is an employee if such dinner, function or affair is sponsored by a person or organization which is regulated by or has official business with the employee' s department or agency. This section shall not prohibit the collection of sums of nominal value to cover the cost of small celebrations or other small events (such as birthday or holiday parties) held within agency/departmental offices. H. Legislative Requests and Inquiries All requests or inquiries from public officials or their staff must be referred to the agency/department head or his/her designee before any action is taken, unless employees are directed to handle such requests otherwise by the agency/ department head or his/her designee.

For employees hired on or after August 1, 2003: If the spouse of an employee is covered by any PEBTF health care plan, and he/she is eligible for coverage under another employer's plan(s), the spouse shall be required to enroll in each such plan, which shall be the spouse's primary coverage, as a condition of the spouse's eligibility for coverage by the PEBTF plan(s), without regard to whether the spouse's plan requires cost sharing or to whether the spouse's employer offers an incentive to the spouse not to enroll.
b. For employees hired before August 1, 2003: Effective October 1, 2003, if the spouse of an employee covered by any PEBTF health plan also is eligible for coverage under another employer's plan(s), the spouse shall be required to enroll in each such plan, provided that the plan in question does not require an employee contribution by the spouse or the spouse's employer does not offer an incentive to the spouse not to enroll. Once covered by another employer's plan, that plan will be the spouse's primary coverage, and the PEBTF plan will be secondary.
c. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to modify or adopt these or other spousal eligibility rules.
40
Section 6. a. The Employer shall allow each individual who was eligible as an active employee under the Fund's health benefits plan to elect coverage upon retirement under the Retired Employees Health Program (hereinafter REHP). In addition, dependency coverage shall be allowed where the dependents of the annuitant qualify under such Program.
b. Employees who retire prior to July 1, 2004 shall be eligible to elect coverage in the REHP plan of benefits in effect on June 30, 2003, as modified by the Employer from time-to-time. Effective July 1, 2004, the Employer will modify the REHP plan of benefits to conform to the medical and prescription benefits in effect for the active employees. Employees retiring on or after July 1, 2004, shall be eligible to elect coverage in the modified REHP plan of benefits. Annuitants who are eligible for Medicare will participate in Medicare supplemental medical plans, and those annuitants who are eligible to enroll in Medicare Part B will not receive benefits through the REHP for benefits which are provided by Medicare Part B. It is understood that the REHP plan of benefits may be amended or modified by the Employer from time-to-time.
c. For those who retire prior to July 1, 2005 and elect REHP coverage, the Employer shall continue to pay the full cost of coverage under the REHP. Those who retire on or after July 1, 2005, and elect REHP coverage shall be required to contribute to the cost of coverage. The annual contribution rate shall be one percent (1.0%) of the employee's final annual gross salary at the time of retirement from State service, and will be payable monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual contribution rate.
d. The REHP is developed and administered in a cost effective and beneficial manner by the Fund, subject only to the prior approval of the Office of Administration and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the REHP Participation Agreement between the Employer and the Fund.
e. The Employer shall continue to pay the cost of coverage, subject to the required annuitant shares, for annuitants who retire under (1), (2) or (3) below and who have elected REHP coverage:
(1) Retirement at or after superannuation age with at least 15 years of credited service (20 years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems, except that
(a) an employee who leaves State employment prior to superannuation age and subsequently retires at or after superannuation age must have 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems,
(b) an employee who is furloughed prior to superannuation age and subsequently retires at or after superannuation age during the recall period must have 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems,
41
(c) an employee who leaves State employment prior to superannuation age and is subsequently rehired and then retires at or after superannuation age must have 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems with at least three years of credited service from the most recent date of reemployment. However, if the departure from State employment was due to furlough and the employee returns during the recall period, this three year requirement will not apply. If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply,
(d) an employee who leaves State employment subsequent to superannuation age and is subsequently rehired and then retires must have 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems with at least three years of credited service from the most recent date of reemployment. However, if the departure from State employment was due to furlough and the employee returns during the recall period, this three year requirement will not apply. If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply.
(2) Disability retirement, which requires at least five years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems, except that, if an employee had previously qualified based on an approved disability retirement, then returns and retires under a normal or early retirement, he or she must retire at or after superannuation age with 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems or 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems or
(3) Other retirement with at least 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems, except that an employee who leaves State employment, is subsequently rehired and retires must have at least 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems with at least three years of credited service from the most recent date of reemployment. However, if the departure from State employment was due to furlough and the employee returns during the recall period, this three year requirement will not apply. If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply.
(4) All employees who are age 60 or over on March 1, 1992 and also have at least five years of credited service under the Retirement Code, whether it has been purchased as of that date or eligible to be purchased as of that date, will be ""grandfathered in"" and the total years of service requirement for fully state paid REHP coverage for those employees will be ten years of credited service rather than fifteen. The three-year rehire rule will not apply to such employees.
Section 7. When an employee dies as a result of a work-related accident, the Fund shall continue to provide medical plan benefits and supplemental benefits, as determined and extended
42
by the Fund, to the spouse and eligible dependents of the employee until the spouse remarries or becomes eligible for coverage under another employer's health plan. Annual certification of noncoverage will be required.
The medical plan benefits and supplemental benefits will be converted to the REHP at the time when the employee would have reached age 60.
ARTICLE 22 WORK-RELATED INJURIES
Section 1. An employee who sustains a work-related injury during the term of this Agreement as a result of which the employee is disabled, if so determined by a decision issued under the operation of the Workers' Compensation Program, shall be entitled to use accumulated sick, annual, or personal leave or injury leave without pay. While using accumulated leave, the employee will be paid a supplement to Workers' Compensation of full pay reduced by an amount that yields a net pay, including Workers' Compensation and Social Security Disability Benefits, that is equal to the employee's net pay immediately prior to the injury. Net pay prior to injury is defined as gross base pay minus federal, state, and local withholding, unemployment compensation tax, Social Security and retirement contributions. One full day of accumulated leave (7.5 or 8 hours as appropriate) will be charged for each day the supplement is paid. Accumulated leave and injury leave without pay may be used for an aggregate of l2 months or for the duration of the disability, whichever is lesser, except that, if only accumulated leave is used, it may be used beyond 12 months until exhausted or until the disability ceases, whichever occurs sooner. In no case however will the aggregate of l2 months extend beyond three years from the date the injury occurred. If no leave is available under this Section, the provisions of Section 12 may apply.
For temporary employees, accumulated leave and injury leave without pay shall be available for an aggregate of up to 12 months, for the duration of the disability or for the scheduled duration of the temporary employment, whichever is the least. In no case, however, will the aggregate of 12 months extend beyond three years from the date the injury occurred.
The employee election to use or not use accumulated leave under this section cannot change more than once.
Section 2. An employee who works a reduced number of hours (part-time) due to partial disability may use leave in accordance with Section 1. Pay for accumulated leave used will be calculated in accordance with Section 1, based on the net amount of lost earnings.
Section 3. Retirement credited service for the period of time that the employee is using leave under this Article, shall be determined in accordance with the State Employes' Retirement Code.
Section 4. At the expiration of the leave under Section 1, if an employee continues to receive Workers' Compensation, the employee will be placed on leave without pay in accordance with
43
Section 7 below and will not be entitled to receive state-paid coverage for life insurance and state payments toward coverage for health benefits.
Section 5. An employee is required to refund to the Employer the amount of any overpayment. In no case shall an employee be entitled to full pay and Workers' Compensation and/or Social Security for the same period. The Employer shall recover any amount in excess of the paid supplement to workers' compensation as described in Section 1. Failure to apply for or report Social Security or other applicable disability benefits to the Employer will result in the termination of the leave under Section 1.
Section 6. State-paid coverage for life insurance state payments toward coverage for health benefits as provided in Articles 20 and 2l, will continue for the period of time that the employee is on leave under Sections 1 and 12.
Section 7. An employee has the right to return to a position in the same or equivalent classification held before being disabled, for a period of up to three years from the date the injury occurred provided the employee is fully capable of performing the duties of that position, subject to the furlough provisions of Article 25, Seniority. This guarantee expires if the disability ceases prior to the expiration of the three year period and the employee does not return to work immediately or if the employee retires or otherwise terminates employment. During the period of time between the end of the leave under Section 1 or Sections 12, where applicable and the end of the guarantee in this section, the employee will be on leave without pay.
Disabled employees receiving Workers' Compensation will be notified 90 days prior to the expiration of the three year period. The notification will include information concerning the employee's right to apply for disability retirement, if eligible. If the employee does not receive 90 days notice, the employee's right to return will not be extended. However, the leave without pay will be extended for 90 days from the date of notification to enable the employee if eligible to apply for disability retirement.
The right of return for temporary employees shall be limited to th e scheduled duration of the temporary employment.
Section 8. The compensation for disability retirement arising out of work-related injuries shall be in accordance with the State Employes' Retirement Code.
Section 9. An employee who sustains a work-related injury, during the period of this Agreement, if so
determined by a decision issued under the operation of the Workers' Compensation Program, may use
sick, annual, or personal leave for the purpose of continued medical treatment of the work-related injury
in accordance with Articles 8, 10, and 11. If no paid leave is available, an employee may use leave
without pay. Each absence shall not exceed the minimum amount of time necessary to obtain the
medical treatment. Employees shall make reasonable efforts to schedule medical appointments during
non-work hours or at times that will minimize absence from work. Verification of the length of the
medical appointment may be required. This section is not applicable to any absence for which
Workers'
Compensation
is
payable.
When
44
Compensation is payable, the provisions of Section 1 shall apply.
Section 10. Sections 4, 6, and 8 of this Article shall not apply to temporary employees.
Section 11. Sections 1 through 10, and 12 of this Article shall not be applicable to employees whose injuries are within the scope of either Act l93 of l935, P.L. 477, as amended, or Act 632 of l959, P.L. l7l8, as amended.
Section 12. An employee who is disabled due to a recurrence of a work-related injur y after three years from the date the injury occurred, or before three years if the leave entitlement in Section 1 has been depleted, shall be entitled to use accumulated leave and injury leave without pay while disabled for a period of up to 12 weeks. To be eligible to use injury leave without pay, the employee must have been at work at least 1250 hours within the previous 12 months. The 12 week period will be reduced by any other leave used within the previous 12 months that was designated as leave under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. If only accumulated leave is used, it may be used beyond 12 weeks until exhausted or until the disability ceases, whichever occurs sooner. While using accumulated leave, the leave will be charged and paid in accordance with Section 1.
Section 13. It is understood by both parties that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, USC Section 2601 et seq. and that leave granted in accordance with Sections 1and 12, shall be designated as leave under the provisions of the Act.
Section 14. It is understood by both parties that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
ARTICLE 23 CLASSIFICATION
Section 1. The position classification plan, as established and maintained by the Employer, consists of a schedule of classification titles with classification specifications for each classification which define and describe representative duties and responsibilities and set forth the minimum requirements and qualifications essential to the work of the classification. Only in those instances where there is a substantial change in permanent job duties or job content during the term of this Agreement which justifies a change in job classification or where a claim of a longstanding misclassification exists may the employees process an appeal for a reallocation of their position through the grievance procedure as set forth below:
STEP I. The employee shall present the grievance in writing to the head of the employee's institution, community health district or agency central office unit or their designee. For grievances seeking the reallocation of a position, the employee shall attach to the grievance a description of the job. Grievances under Section 4 below shall be filed within 15 working days of the occurrence of the action giving rise to the grievance or knowledge of its occurrence.
The institutional or local management designee shall attempt to resolve the matter and report a decision to the Local Union Representative and/or the employee within 15 working days.
STEP II. An appeal from an unfavorable disposition at Step I shall be presented in writing by
45
the employee or the Union representative to the agency head within 15 working days after the response from Step I is due. The agency head or designee shall respond in writing to the employee and Union representative within 15 working days after receipt of the appeal.
STEP III. In the event the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved in Step II, written appeal may be made by the employee or Union representative within 15 working days of the Step II decision to the Bureau of Personnel, Classification and Pay Division, Office of Administration. Th e appeal shall contain a copy of the grievance, including a description of the job and a copy of the Step I and Step II decisions. The Bureau of Personnel, Classification and Pay Division, Office of Administration, shall issue a decision in writing to the Union within 15 working days after receipt of the appeal.
Employer determinations prior to Step 3 can be reversed by the Office of Administration.
If a determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal that a position should be upgraded, the employee shall be promoted retroactively to the date the grievance was filed in writing.
If a final determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review that a position should be downgraded, the employee shall be demoted to the proper classification and pay range at the nearest level (step) not greater than the employee's current salary. If the employee's salary is greater than the maximum level (step) of the lower pay range, there shall be no reduction in salary. The effective date of the classification change shall be the first day of the first pay period subsequent to the response.
If a final determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review that a position should be reclassified to another class in the same pay range, the effective date of the classification change shall be the first day of the first pay period subsequent to the response.
Section 2. An employee shall be permitted to have a representative of the Union at each step of the grievance procedure up to and including Step III. Regardless of whether or not an employee wants Union representation, a Union representative will be given an opportunity to be present at the adjustment of the grievance and such adjustment will not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Upon request by an employee or Union representative, a grievance meeting may be scheduled at Steps II and/or III. Requests for such meetings shall not be unreasonably denied. Such
46
meetings may be rescheduled, if necessary if Union representation is temporarily unavailable to the employee. Where rescheduling occurs, the time limits for response to the grievance will be suspended during the postponement period.
The Union shall furnish the Employer representative with the names and work locations of grievance representatives/delegates and shall notify the Employer of any changes.
A reasonable number of witnesses, when required, shall be allowed to participate in the grievance procedure.
An aggrieved employee and Union representatives, if employees of the Employer, shall be granted reasonable time during working hours, if required, to process grievances in accordance with this Article without loss of pay or leave time.
Nothing in this Article shall interfere with the rights of individual employees or a group of employees to present grievances and to have them adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 606 of the Public Employe Relations Act.
Section 3. The Union, in response to an unfavorable decision at Step 3, may submit classification appeals to an arbitration panel. The panel shall consist of three members; one member appointed by the Employer, one member appointed by the Union, and a third member selected by the parties jointly from a list of five names to be mutually agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The third member shall not be affiliated, directly or indirectly, with any labor organization or be an employee of the Commonwealth and must be knowledgeable in the field of position classification.
The panel shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of this Article nor recommend any alterations or revisions to the Commonwealth's classification and compensation plans. The panel shall be confined to deciding the proper classification in the then existing classification plan for the position in dispute.
The findings of the panel shall be submitted to the parties within 30 days after the hearing or receipt of transcript when taken. The determination of the panel shall be final and binding in those cases where an employee's position is downgraded as a result of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review. In all other cases the decision of the panel shall be advisory only as to the Employer.
The panel shall meet monthly if necessary for the purpose of hearing appeals under this section.
A grievance that has been appealed to arbitration will be deemed withdrawn six months after the date the grievance was appealed to arbitration unless the case has been scheduled or this timeframe has been extended by mutual agreement. Grievances that are pending arbitration on the effective date of this Agreement will be considered withdrawn six months from the date this Agreement is signed by the parties unless the case has been scheduled or this timeframe has been extended by mutual agreement. The Office of Administration will notify the Union in writing 30 days prior to the expiration of the six month period set forth above and prior to any case being considered withdrawn.
Section 4. The Union recognizes the right of the Employer to direct its working forces, which includes the assignment of work to individual employees, and it further recognizes that such assignments
47
may include work outside an employee's classification. However, it is understood that assignments outside of classification shall be made in a manner consistent with the Employer's operations and organizational requirements.
Whenever an employee within the bargaining unit is temporarily required by the Employer or the circumstances of the situation to perform in general the duties and responsibilities of a position in a higher rated classification that are separate and distinct from those of the employee's own position for a period of any five full cumulative days or ten full one -half cumulative days in a calendar quarter, the employee shall be compensated, retroactive to the time the assignment took place, at an amount equal to four and one half percent of the employee's current rate of pay or at the starting rate of the pay range for the higher classification, whichever is greater. Such employee, while temporarily working and being paid in a higher class, will also be paid at the higher rate for a holiday provided the employee is charged to perform the higher level duties on the employee's scheduled workday immediately before and immediately after such holiday and is paid at the higher rate on those days. The holiday shall not count toward the requirement for five full cumulative days in a quarter. Employees who are charged to perform higher class work for a full day or a full half day and who take leave for a portion of that day will be compensated in increments of one-quarter hour for the partial day worked in the higher class after the five full day or ten full half day threshold has been met. Furthermore, employees who work out of class for less than a full day as a result of overlapping shifts with a higher level position will be paid out of class for all hours worked in the higher class after the five full day or ten full half day threshold has been met. Once the requirement for the five full cumulative day thr eshold or the ten full one half cumulative day threshold has been met, payment will be included in the bi-weekly paycheck. If the position in the higher rated classification is filled permanently by other than the person temporarily filling the position, the person temporarily assigned shall be returned to the person's previous position and compensation, but shall receive any increments and service credits for such increments to which the person would have been entitled had the person remained in the person's normal assignment.
The duties and responsibilities that are separate and distinct from those of the employee's own position means that the work in a position in a higher rated classification includes duties or responsibilities that are different from the work the employee does in the employee's own position, but also means that pay at the higher rate is payable even though both positions may include overlapping duties and responsibilities.
An employee or employees shall not be temporarily assigned to perform in general the duties and responsibilities of a position in a higher rated classification for more than nine continuous months or the length of the leave of absence of the employee being replaced, whichever is greater.
48
In addition, if the Employer assigns an employee on a temporary basis to a lower classification or if an employee performs some duties and functions assigned to a lower classification, the employee so assigned shall receive the compensation of the higher level to which the employee is regularly assigned. The Employer, however, at any individual work site shall make such assignments on a non-discriminatory basis so as to equalize the same among the employees within the classification from which assignments are made, so long as such equalization does not interfere with efficient operating procedures.
Grievances arising from the provisions of this section shall be submitted in writing and the employee shall attempt to include the dates on which the alleged out of class work occurred and a description of the alleged higher level work performed. The failure of the employee to provide the required information will not affect the validity of the grievance. Grievances pertaining to this section may be processed through an arbitration panel consisting of one Union staff member, one staff member of the Employer, and one permanent arbitrator jointly selected by the parties who is knowledgeable in the field of position classification. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding.
For the purpose of this Section, the calendar quarters shall be defined as beginning with the first full pay period in January through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, and October 1 through the last full pay period of the leave calendar year, which is the pay period that includes December 31.
Section 5. Under Sections 3 and 4 above, all fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties except where one of the parties of this Agreement requests a postponement of a previously scheduled arbitration meeting which results in a postponement charge. The postponing party shall pay such charge unless such postponement results in a settlement of the appeal in which event the postponement charge shall be divided equally by the parties. Each party shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its own case. Either party desiring a record of the proceedings shall pay for the record and make a copy available without charge to the arbitrator.
Section 6. The Employer shall notify the Union of class specification revisions to all classes that are presently in the certified bargaining unit for which the Union is the representative and of class specifications and pay ranges of proposed classes that the Employer may reasonably anticipate will be placed in the certified bargaining unit, prior to the submission of these changes to the Executive Board of the Commonwealth. The Union will submit its comments, in writing, to the Employer within l5 working days of receipt of the notification. If written comments are not received from the Union within l5 working days, the Employer will contact the Union, by telephone, before submitting the proposals to the Executive Board. Reasonable written requests by the Union for time extensions will be granted. In addition, the Employer shall notify the Union of the commencement of classification studies of classifications in this bargaining unit.
49
ARTICLE 24 DISCHARGE, DEMOTION, SUSPENSION AND DISCIPLINE
Section 1. The Employer shall not demote, suspend, discharge or take any disciplinary action against an employee without just cause. An employee may appeal a demotion, suspension, or discharge beginning at the first step of the grievance procedure within 15 working days of the date of its occurrence. The Union shall be notified promptly by the Employer of any demotion, suspension, or discharge.
Section 2. Any action instituted under Section l of this Article shall be implemented within a reasonable period of time after the event giving rise to such disciplinary action or knowledge thereof.
Section 3. In the event any action is taken by the Employer under the provisions of this Article which involves patient/resident/inmate/client abuse and a grievance is filed by an employee, the
arbitrator shall not consider the failure of the patient/resident/inmate/client to appear as prejudicial.
Section 4. The Employer will attempt to discipline employees in such a manner so as not to embarrass the employee before the public or other employees. It must be kept in mind, however, that where insubordination or flouting of authority by an employee in public and in the presence of other employees takes place, the Employer shall not be restricted by the operation of this section. The Employer will not take any disciplinary action against employees for appropriately advocating or appropriately attempting to bring about improvements in standards of patient care.
Section 5. The provisions of this Article shall not apply during an employee's probationary period which shall be the initial 180 calendar days of employment except for employees in trainee classes whose probationary period shall coincide with the trainee period. The probationary period can be extended by mutual agreement between the Union and the Employer for an additional period during which time Section l shall not apply. Periods of leave without pay and periods of time during which an employee is using paid leave to supplement Workers' Compensation shall not count toward the initial probationary period or any extension period.
Section 6. This Article shall not apply to demotions resulting from an employee appeal, an Employer-initiated classification review or unsuccessful completion of a probationary period upon promotion.
Section 7. After a period of two years, a written reprimand or reference to an oral reprimand shall be removed from the employee's official personnel folder if no intervening incidents of the same or a similar nature have occurred.
Section 8. The Employer and the Union agree to continue the alternative forms of discipline in lieu of suspension actions program in accordance with the side letter.
50
ARTICLE 25 SENIORITY
Section 1. a. Under the terms of this Agreement, the term ""seniority"" means a preferred position for specific purposes which one employee within a seniority unit may have over another employee within the same seniority unit because of a greater length of service within the state government or a particular organizational or occupational segment thereof.
(1) The seniority unit for lateral transfer and furlough shall consist of that group of employees in an institution or a Department of Health District or the Department of Health Central Office within which seniority preference is exercised.
(2) Unless otherwise stated herein, seniority refers to Bargaining Unit seniority.
(3) Bargaining Unit seniority standing shall be determined by the length of unbroken (as defined in Section 2) service with the Employer subsequent to July l, l973, in bargaining unit classifications covered by this agreement and service prior to July 1, 1998, in classifications covered by the nursing and medical supportive services first-level supervisory unit. For employees who occupied a bargaining unit classification covered by this agreement on July l, l973, all unbroken service with the Employer prior to July l, l973, will be counted toward Bargaining Unit seniority including leaves of absence without pay of one year or less. Employees who did not occupy a bargaining unit classification on July l, l973, but did so prior to that date, will have such service counted toward Bargaining Unit seniority, if there has been no break in service, including leaves of absence without pay of one year or less.
Effective July 1, 1991, employees will accrue Bargaining Unit seniority during legal strike absences.
(4) Employees who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during periods of time listed below shall be responsible for providing proof of military service to their human resource officer within 60 days of their first day of work in order to receive seniority credit in accordance with the Veterans' Preference Act, 51 Pa. C.S. 7107 et seq. Failure to provide the required proof of service during the time period shall bar the employee or Union from claiming credit for such service at a later date.
Applicable periods are as follows:
1. World War I - April 6, l9l7 - November ll, l9l8 2. World War II - December 7, l94l - September 2, l945 3. Korea - June 25, l950 - July 27, l953 4. Vietnam - August 5, l964 - January 28, l973
b. Seniority credit for each employee is maintained as a total number of days. Employees will accrue seniority in accordance with the following procedure: The number of
51
regular hours paid each bi-weekly pay period plus the number of hours approved Leave without Pay will be accumulated. This total number of hours will be divided by 7.5 or 8 as applicable and rounded up to the next higher day. The result will be added to the employee's accumulated total.
Section 2. The following shall constitute a break in service: resignation, separation for just cause, retirement, absence without leave for five consecutive working days, failure to report within ten consecutive working days of recall, expiration of recall period, failure to report after leave, and acceptance of other permanent employment while on leave. This shall not restrict the Employer's right to take whatever personnel action it deems warranted for any of the above. If service is broken by any of the above, the employee shall lose Bargaining Unit seniority. If an employee is returned within one year after such break in service, the employee shall be entitled to credit for seniority purposes for the time accrued up to the time break in service occurred, but shall not be entitled to any credit for the time represented by such break in service.
Employees who are furloughed and who file applications for retirement benefits which are subsequently approved, will be considered to have a break in service as of the date of the approval of benefits by the State Employes' Retirement Board.
A furloughed employee who applies for and receives retirement benefits from the State Employes' Retirement Board shall forfeit all recall rights as of the date of approval of benefits by the State Employes' Retirement Board.
Section 3. Seniority lists shall be prepared for each seniority group and revised where necessary every six months. Appropriate service information shall be shown thereon to permit application of various seniority provisions. Such lists shall include both full-time and part-time employees and shall be posted on the appropriate bulletin boards. Seniority lists shall be provided to the designated local facility representative upon request not more than once every six months.
Section 4. Postings: The Employer agrees that all vacancies (such as those positions vacated through resignation, retirement or permanent transfer of an incumbent or positions newly created by the Employer) which are to be filled within the bargaining unit will be posted at appropriate work locations within appropriate seniority units prior to the filling of such vacancies for a period of at least 10 calendar days unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or unless an emergency requires a lesser period of time.
Section 5. Furloughs and Bumping: When the Employer determines that a furlough is necessary within a seniority unit, employees will be furloughed in the inverse order of Bargaining Unit seniority. Employees affected by furlough who have the requisite seniority and skill and ability shall bump laterally or down in the following manner:
a. If an employee is affected by furlough the employee shall bump laterally within the classification within the seniority unit as defined in Section l a(l) provided that the employee has more Bargaining Unit seniority than the employee with the least Bargaining Unit seniority in that classification and has the requisite skill and ability.
52
b . If the affected employee is unable under Section a. above to bump within the classification the employee shall bump laterally or down within the seniority unit as defined in Section l a(l) into any other classification previously held within the bargaining unit using the seniority procedure specified in a. above.
c. If the affected employee is unable to bump into any position as provided in subsections a. and b. above, the employee shall be furloughed.

After the bids are received, the Employer, in its sole discretion, will choose to fill the vacancy by lateral transfer between shifts or by appointing an individual from outside the seniority unit who expresses an interest in the position or whose name appears on the appropriate Civil Service list. If the method chosen is lateral transfer between shifts, the employee with the greatest bargaining unit seniority who bids on a lateral transfer between shifts and who possesses the requisite skill and ability will be awarded the position. Any resulting vacancy will be posted and filled in accordance with this subsection until the Employer in its sole discretion chooses to fill the vacancy by appointing an individual from outside the seniority unit.
b. Filling a Forensic Registered Nurse vacancy (as defined in Article 25, Section 4)
(1) When a Forensic Registered Nurse vacancy occurs it shall be posted for ten (10) days.

After the bids are received, the Employer, in its sole discretion, will choose to fill the vacancy by lateral transfer between shifts or by reassigning the most senior Registered Nurse at the same work location who expresses an interest in the position.
(3) If the method chosen is lateral transfer between shifts, the employee with the greatest bargaining unit seniority who bids on a lateral transfer between shifts and who possesses the requisite skill and ability will be awarded the position.
(4) If the method chosen is the reassignment of the most senior Registered Nurse who expresses interest in the position, the employee will be reassigned with the appropriate increase in salary for a six month period during which the employee's work performance will be assessed. If the employee passes the assessment period, the employee's classification will be changed retroactive to the date of the initial assignment. If the employee's work performance is unacceptable and the reassignment is terminated with an appropriate decrease in salary, the employee or the union may follow the review process contained in the side letter between the parties. The termination of a FRN Nurse work assignment will not be arbitrary or capricious.
(5) Any resulting vacancy will be posted and filled in accordance with this subsection.

(2) The Public Health Program Representative position vacated by the lateral transfer and any subsequent resulting vacancies will be posted for ten (10) days. Employees in the Public Health Program Representative classification may bid for the vacancy. After the bids are received, the employer, in its sole discretion, will choose to fill the vacancy by lateral transfer within the Community Health District or by appointing an individual from outside the Health District who expressed an interest in the position or by appointing an individual whose name appears on the appropriate Civil Service list.
e. Realignment of Registered Nurse staff when no vacancy (as defined by Article 25, Section 4) exists.
(1) When a realignment of staff is necessary, between shifts, the Employer will seek volunteers who possess the requisite skill and ability, and if applicable, related work experience, from the classification on the shift which will be losing staff.

g. For the purpose of this section, lateral transfer means movement from one position to another within the same classification.
h. All postings referred to in a. above will contain the classification and shift of the position to be filled.
Nothing contained above shall impair the Employer's right to reassign/transfer employees between patient care areas on the same shift.

i. Involuntary transfer from one state health center to another within a seniority unit shall be in inverse order of bargaining unit seniority.
Section 9. Grievances relating to the interpretation, application and implementation of Sections 5, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14 of this Article shall be filed at the first step.

Such third member shall not be affiliated, directly or indirectly with any labor organizations or be an employee of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The decision of the panel, hereinbefore described, shall be final and binding on the parties to the Agreement. The panel shall meet monthly for the purpose of adjusting grievances under this section.
Section 10. When in the exercise of seniority rights provided hereunder, two or more employees are deemed relatively equal in skill and ability and have the same seniority date or amount of seniority, preferential rights shall be determined by lot.
Section 11. Placement: If an employee is unable to execute a bump as provided by Article 25, Section 5, and is placed on a furlough list, the Commonwealth will attempt to place the employee in a budgeted, available, uncommitted vacancy in a classification covered by the Agreement to which there are no seniority claims in the following manner:
57
a. Placement will be to positions in classifications outside the employee's seniority unit in the same or lower pay range covered by the Agreement in agencies under the jurisdiction of the Governor and will be carried out in an order consistent with the bumping order outlined in Article 25, Section 5, provided the employee possesses the requisite skill and ability. If such placement is not possible, the employee will be placed in a position covered by this Agreement for which the employee qualifies, provided the pay range for the classification is equal to or lower than the pay range for the employee's classification at the time of furlough.
b. Geographic limitations for the application of this Section will be designated by the employee by completing a placement questionnaire. The employee may choose up to ten counties in which the employee would be available or a statewide availability. The provisions of this Section will be implemented at the time the employee's completed placement questionnaires are received by the Secretary of Administration or designee and will continue for twelve months from the date of furlough. The provisions of this section will not be implemented for employees who do not return a completed placement questionnaire.
c. Placement will be made in order of Bargaining Unit seniority; however, employees with an earlier furlough date will be placed in vacancies before employees with a later furlough date.
d. Civil service employees will have placement rights only to civil service vacancies, except that if an appropriate vacancy in a civil service position is not available and an employee previously held a non-civil service position in a classification to which the employee would have rights under this section, placement in that non-civil service classification will be attempted consistent with the requirements outlined in paragraph l of this section. Non-civil service employees will have placement rights only to non-civil service vacancies, except that if an appropriate vacancy in a non-civil service position is not available and the employee previously was a member of the classified service in a classification to which the employee would have rights under this Section, placement in that civil service classification will be attempted consistent with the requirements outlined in paragraph one of this Section and in accordance with the Civil Service Act and Rules.
e.
Employees will be offered placement in one vacant position. If an employee declines
the offer of placement, the employee's rights under this section cease. The furloughed employee shall
retain recall rights as outlined in Article 25, Section 7.
Employees placed in vacancies in the same classification from which they were
furloughed will lose recall rights as outlined by Article 25, Section 7. Those employees placed in a
lower classification will retain their recall rights under Article 25, Section 7.
g. If an employee accepts an offer of placement under this Section, any other placement rights to which the employee may be entitled under this Section cease. In addition, such employee shall complete an ""Availability for Temporary Employment"" questionnaire. If an employee indicates a desire not to be offered placement to temporary positions no such offers will
58
be made and placement rights to permanent positions will not be affected. However, if an employee indicates a desire to be offered a temporary position and refuses such an offer, the employee shall forfeit all placement rights.
Section 12. A regular or probationary employee whose position is either transferred to another agency or reassigned to another geographic location within an agency shall not be furloughed or terminated as the result of such reassignment or transfer unless the employee refuses the position in its new location. If the employee accepts the transfer or reassignment, the employee shall retain seniority credits.
Section 13. Employees who formerly occupied classifications included in this Agreement, and who are not now in the bargaining unit and are affected by furlough may not bump into classifications previously held in this bargaining unit.

2. PRN Nurses will have the right to bid and be selected for vacancies in the Registered Nurse and Forensic Registered Nurse classifications.

Where an employee of the Commonwealth represented by District 1199P, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC, has the right to process a grievance through either the procedure provided herein or through the Pennsylvania Civil Service Commission and files an appeal with the Commission, either the contract grievance procedure shall cease, if the employee has submitted a contract grievance, or the employee shall not be entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure. If the appeal to the Commission is withdrawn by the employee or not accepted by the Commission within the time limits prescribed in Section 2 of this Article, the processing of a timely filed contract grievance shall be permitted. Additionally, if the appeal to the Commission is not accepted outside the time limits prescribed in Section 2 of this Article, the employee shall be entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure within fifteen (15) working days of the date of the Commission's denial of appeal.

In addition, in order for a grievance to be discussed at Step 1, the respective Employer worksite designee must have received a written confirmation of the grievance at least fifteen (15) working days prior to the prescheduled Step 1 meeting. This period may, however, be modified by mutual agreement.
The parties agree the respective Employer designee and the Union counterpart must schedule and meet on a monthly Step 1 basis, if necessary, in order to attempt to resolve all outstanding grievances. At the Step 1 meeting, the parties will advise each other of all of the then known facts, including witnesses, and furnish copies of relevant reports or investigations upon which the party will rely in proving and/or supporting its respective position.
63
When special circumstances preclude the disclosure of confidential patient, resident, client, student or inmate information at the Step 1 meeting, the case will be handled in accordance with the agreed upon procedures to be developed by the parties.
Any agreed upon final settlement of a grievance reached at Step 1 shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Union and the Employer designee. Decisions at Step 1 shall not be used as precedent for any subsequent case.
After the Step 1 meeting has been held, and the then known information the parties intend to rely on to support their respective positions has been discussed and exchanged, the respective Employer designee must, if the case is not settled at this point, make a written disposition of the matter to the Union within fifteen (15) working days from the date of the Step 1 meeting.
STEP 2. If the Step 1 response is not satisfactory, or a response has not been received by the Union within fifteen (15) working days of the Step 1 meeting, the Union shall have fifteen (15) working days after the Commonwealth's response is received or due, to appeal the decision by filing its grievance with the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee. Such submission, in a form to be established by the Committee, shall be made in writing, and shall be filed in accordance with the established procedures with the Office of Administration, Bureau of Labor Relations (OA-BLR). This office will officially ""docket"" all grievances submitted by the Union and will furnish official notice confirming the docketing of all cases scheduled to be heard by the State Committee, along with the date, place, and time of the scheduled meeting. Dockets will be sent to the affected Employer (Division of Labor Relations) and District 1199P, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC.
Failure of the Union to submit grievances to the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee within the fifteen (15) day appeal period specified above, shall be cause for the Commonwealth to consider the matter ""settled and withdrawn."" Any later discovered or developed evidence, not previously disclosed to the other party at the Step 1 meeting must be submitted to the other side as soon as practical after discovery and/or development, but in no event later than 48 hours before the Step 2 hearing. (See Rule 4, Section 3 of the Rules of Procedure, Appendix E, for Exceptions).
Decisions of the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee shall operate as precedent.
The Committee at Step 2 shall have the right to hear testimony from both parties, investigate all relevant facts and render a final and binding decision. Each case shall be considered on its merits and the collective bargaining agreement shall constitute the basis upon which the decision shall be rendered.
The Committee shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of the Agreement. The Committee shall be confined to the precise issue submitted, as outlined on the original grievance form, and shall have no authority to determine any other issues not so submitted. If the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee is unable to reach a decision by majority vote, the matter will be considered ""deadlocked"".
64
STEP 3. An appeal from a deadlocked decision at Step 2 may be initiated by the Union, by written notice of the intent to proceed to arbitration. This notice must be sent within fifteen (15) working days after the deadlocked decision from Step 2 to the Office of Administration (Bureau of Labor Relations), and the affected Employer (Division of Labor Relations) when the appeal is filed.
Arbitration
The impartial arbitrator is to be selected by agreement between the respective Co-Chairpersons of the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee within fifteen (15) working days after the notice has been given. If the parties fail to agree on an impartial arbitrator, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation to submit a list of seven (7) possible arbitrators to the respective Co-Chairpersons.
The Co-Chairpersons shall, within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of said list, select the arbitrator by alternately striking one name from the list until one name remains. The Employer Chairperson shall strike the first name.
Each case shall be considered on its merits and the collective bargaining agreement shall constitute the basis upon which the decision shall be rendered.
The arbitrator shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of the Agreement.
The arbitrator shall be confined to the precise issue submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issues not so submitted.
A decision of the Step 2 Joint State Committee or by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. The arbitrator shall be required to issue a decision within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing.
Time Limits
All of the time limits contained in this section may be modified by mutual agreement. The granting of any modification at any step shall not be deemed to establish a precedent.
Costs
Each party shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its own case. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties, except where one of the parties to this Agreement requests a postponement of a previously scheduled arbitration hearing which results in a postponement charge. The postponing party shall pay such charge unless such postponement results in a settlement of the grievance, in which event the postponement charge shall be divided by the parties.
65
A postponement charge resulting from a joint postponement request shall be shared equally by the parties.
Either party desiring a record of the proceedings shall pay for the record and make a copy available without charge to the arbitrator.
Section 3. An employee shall be permitted to have a representative of the Union present at each step of the grievance procedure, up to and including Step 2; subject, however, to Section 606, Article VI of the Public Employe Relations Act. Upon request by a Union representative, a Step 1 grievance meeting will be postponed or rescheduled, if necessary, if a Union Representative is temporarily unavailable to the employee. Where this occurs, the time limits for response to the grievance will be suspended during the postponement period.
Delegates
Employees selected by the Union to act as Union representatives shall be known as delegates. The Union shall furnish the Commonwealth with the names and work locations of grievance representatives and shall notify the Commonwealth of any changes.
Lost Time
A reasonable number of witnesses shall be permitted to attend Committee meetings without suffering the loss of any pay, when their presence is required because of the Commonwealth's refusal to accept the witnesses' written statement, as provided for in the attached Rules of Procedure (Appendix F). Grievants shall be treated in exactly the same manner as witnesses under this procedure.
An employee who presents a grievance or sits on a Joint State Committee Panel, shall do so with pay, provided the Union has indicated their desire to have that person participate in the procedure. The number of employees so designated shall not be abused.
State/Agency Wide Grievances
The Union may present grievances concerning agency-wide actions or state-wide actions directly to Step 2 within fifteen (15) working days of the date of the occurrence giving rise to the dispute, or the date when the Union knew, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of its occurrence. However, the Union will meet with the official affected Employer or Office of Administration designee prior to any hearing on such grievances, in order to resolve any factual disputes relating to such Agency-wide or State-wide grievances.

ARTICLE 1 - SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1 . This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the State of Oregon (hereinafter the
""Employer""), acting through its Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit on behalf of the Department of Corrections (hereinafter the ""Agency""), and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFL-CIO) (hereinafter the ""Union""), and is binding upon the Union and the Employer and all designated representatives of the Union and the Employer.
Section 2. The Agencies recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the
employees within the certified or recognized bargaining units. All aspects of the employees' wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment shall be determined by this Agreement, except in regard to recruitment and selection of applicants for initial appointment to State service. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement shall apply to all classified positions (except temporary positions and those positions excludable by ORS 243.650) within the appropriate bargaining units within the Department of Corrections which are:
a. Security Unit - Encompasses all classified employees in strike-prohibited classifications excluding supervisory and confidential employees as defined in ORS 243.650 and employees covered by the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees at Oregon State Penitentiary, Oregon State Correctional Institution, South Fork Forest Camp and Mill Creek Correctional Facility.
b. Oregon State Penitentiary Minimum - Encompasses all strike-prohibited classified employees, excluding supervisory and confidential employees defined in ORS 243.650, working within the Oregon State Penitentiary Minimum.
The parties agree that the term ""classified employee"" does not include temporary employees appointed under the provisions of ORS 240.380 or part-time employees who regularly work thirty-two (32) hours or less per month.
Section 3. If the Agency establishes a new position which is not clearly excluded from the bargaining unit
under ORS 243.650 or reclassifies an existing bargaining unit position, the Employer shall notify the Union in writing within seven (7) days following the action, as to whether or not it believes the classification to be within the bargaining unit. The Union must notify the Employer in writing within ten (10) days from receipt of the notification if it disagrees about the inclusion or exclusion of the classification in the bargaining unit or the matter becomes closed. If notice of the disagreement is received within the ten (10)-day period, the parties shall meet within fourteen (14) days of above notification to discuss the matter. If an agreement is not reached within thirty (30) days, the Union may submit the matter to the Employment Relations Board. Should the matter not be submitted to the Employment Relations Board within the specified thirty (30)-day period, the matter shall be considered resolved.
Section 4. This contract incorporates the sole and complete Agreement between the Agency and the
Union resulting from negotiations held pursuant to the provisions of ORS 243.650 et seq and supersedes all prior labor contracts. It is acknowledged that during negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter appropriate for collective bargaining and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. It shall not be modified in whole or in part except by another written instrument duly executed by the parties.
5
Section 5.
a. The parties agree that the Human Resource Services Division Personnel Policies and
Agency Procedures relating to their implementation are without effect upon the Agency or members of
the bargaining units.
b. Other policies, procedures, and rules of the Agency which directly relate to mandatory
subjects of bargaining as defined by statute and which affect bargaining unit members on the day this
Agreement becomes effective shall be continued, unless modified or deleted elsewhere in this
Agreement. Should the Agency wish to change such a policy, procedure, or rule, or to issue a new
one, notice will be given to the Union. If the Union believes the policy, procedure, or rule to be
unreasonable, then within seven (7) days of the date upon which the Union knows, or by reasonable
diligence should have known, of the subject action, the Union shall request that the Agency meet to
discuss the issue.
c. Such meeting shall occur within fifteen (15) days of:
1. Agreement that the issue is a mandatory subject, or
2. An Employment Relations Board ruling that the issue is a mandatory subject of
bargaining.
If agreement which alters the policy, procedure or rule is reached, it shall be reduced to writing
and signed by both parties. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement within fourteen (14) days
--
the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such expenses shall be
apportioned as in the arbitrator's judgment is equitable. All other expenses shall be borne exclusively
by the party requiring the service or item for which payment is to be made.
g. Time limits specified in this procedure must be observed, unless either party requests a
specific extension of time, which, if agreed to, must be stipulated in writing and shall become part of
the record.
ARTICLE 2 - TERM OF AGREEMENT
Section 1 . This Agreement, and attachments hereto, shall be in full force and effect from the date of
signing of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, through June 30, 2007.
Section 2. The Union will notify the Agency of its selected representatives by December 15, 2006. The
bargaining team shall consist of one (1) member from each local covered by the terms of this Agreement. The Union may utilize up to one hundred (100) hours leave with pay per designated bargaining team representative for the purpose of actual negotiations. The one hundred (100) hours may be increased by mutual agreement of the employer and union.
Section 3. 6
Negotiations for a successor agreement will commence between January 2, 2007, and February 15, 2007, or sooner upon mutual agreement of the parties.
ARTICLE 3 - UNION SECURITY
Section 1 . New Employees. The Agency agrees to inform all new employees hired into positions included in the bargaining
unit of the Union's exclusive recognition, and shall provide all present and future employees in the bargaining unit with a copy of its Agreement, provided the parties shall share equally in the costs of preparation and distribution of the Agreement. The Agency agrees to allow duly certified Union Representatives thirty (30) minutes, when new employee orientation classes are held, to speak to new employees about the Union's exclusive recognition, its benefits, and services available to the membership. This time will not be used for discussion of labor-management disputes.
If the Union Representative is an employee of the institution, the representative will be allowed time off without loss of pay to make the presentation.
Section 2. Union Access. Accredited representatives of the Local, District Council 75, or International American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, upon proper introduction and notice, shall have reasonable access to the premises of the Agency during all working hours to conduct Union business (with appropriate observation of the security regulations of the Agency). During periods of bona fide emergency, this provision may be temporarily suspended by the Agency as required for the duration of the emergency.
Section 3. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the internal business of the Union shall be
conducted by the employees during non-duty time. All policies, procedures, and rules, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be applied
equitably among employees to whom they apply.
Section 4. Stewards. The Union may select, and shall certify in writing to the Agency, employees to act as Union
Stewards. Stewards shall have authority to investigate and resolve grievances and to distribute Union informational material provided that such activity does not interfere with the regular work routine with prior approval of management. The investigation and processing of employee grievances will be permitted during working hours without loss of compensation. If the permitted activities would interfere with either the Steward's or the grievant's duties, management shall, within the next working day, arrange a mutually satisfactory time for the requested activities. Time spent in grievance activities without the proper notification and release by an appropriate supervisor involved will be considered unauthorized leave without pay for both the Steward and the grievant. An employee may request and have present a Shop Steward or Union Representative at any formal discussion on disciplinary actions, or grievance proceedings, or any other matter that might adversely and substantially affect their future employment, pay, or chances for promotion.
Management will provide written notification to an officer of the Local Union and the Union Business Agent of an impending disciplinary action (suspension, reduction, demotion or dismissal) against an employee.
Section 5. Union Business Leave. AFSCME shall indemnify and hold the State and Agency harmless against any and all claims,
damages, suits, or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Employer and/or Agency for the purpose of complying with this provision.
--
If any provision of this Agreement shall be found to be invalid by any court having jurisdiction in respect, thereof, such findings as to such provision shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, and all other terms and provisions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as set forth herein. In such event, the parties shall enter into immediate negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such term or provision.
Section 1 . The Agency and the Union agree to continue their policies of not unlawfully discriminating
against any employee because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, mental or physical
disability, marital status, political affiliation, or union activity. Neither will the Agency discriminate based on sexual orientation.
Section 2. Any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age, mental or physical disability, marital status or political affiliation which is brought to the Union for processing will be submitted directly to the designated appointing authority. If such a grievance is not satisfactorily resolved within thirty (30) days of its submission, it may be submitted to the Bureau of Labor and Industries for resolution.
Section 3. Complaints alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation may be submitted by the Union
to the Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit if not resolved by the Agency. The Labor Relations Unit will review the complaint, attempt to resolve it, and issue its findings to the Agency and the Union. Such complaints may not be advanced pursuant to Article 51.
Section 4. If an employee has a grievance alleging unlawful discrimination based on union activity, it shall
be first pursued through the grievance procedure, however, the parties may mutually agree, in writing, to waive arbitration on any such grievance allowing the matter to be resolved through the Employment Relations Board.
The Union agrees that the Employer retains all inherent rights of management and hereby recognizes the sole and exclusive right of the State of Oregon, as the Employer, to operate and manage its affairs in accordance with its responsibilities to maintain efficient governmental operations. The Employer retains all rights to direct the work of its employees, including, but not limited to, the right to hire, promote, assign, transfer, demote, suspend, or discharge employees for proper cause; to schedule work; determine the processes for accomplishing work; to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; to take action as necessary to carry out the missions of the State; or determine the methods, means, and personnel by which operations are to be carried on, except as modified or circumscribed by the terms of this Agreement. The retention of these rights does not preclude any employee from filing a grievance, pursuant to Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration, or seeking a review of the exercise of these rights, when it is alleged such exercise violates provisions of this Agreement.
The Agency may determine to contract or subcontract work provided that, as to work which is presently and regularly performed by employees in the bargaining unit, the Agency agrees to notify the Union and negotiate the decision and impact of the pending action. It is specifically understood that such negotiations are not required in 1) emergency situations, 2) where the impact is minimal (and not mandatory), or 3) where the assignment of work currently being performed by the bargaining unit members is transferred to other State facilities.
Section 1 . An Employer contribution will be made for each eligible employee who has at least eighty (80)
paid regular hours in the month.
The contribution for eligible participating part time employees with eighty (80) or more hours paid time for the month will be prorated based on the ratio of paid regular hours to full-time hours to the nearest full percent.
a. Effective January 1 , 2005 through December 3 1 , 2005, the Employer shall make a contribution sufficient to cover the premium costs for PEBB health, dental and basic life benefits chosen by each eligible full-time employees who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month.
These Employer contributions are understood to currently cost a monthly composite of eight hundred eighteen dollars ($818) per eligible full-time employee statewide.
b. For plan year 2006, the Employer will increase its monthly contributions a sufficient amount beyond the 2005 statewide composite ($818) to continue to fully pay the PEBB health, dental and basic life benefits chosen by each eligible full-time employee who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month.
c. For plan year January 1 , 2007 through December 31, 2007 the Employer will increase its monthly contributions by up to twelve percent (12%) of the actual monthly composite resulting for plan year 2006, should the cost of insurance premiums increase by that amount or more.
Section 2. PEBB Petition. Should rates for plan year 2007 exceed the Employer contribution, the parties will jointly
petition the Pubic Employees Benefit Board to use reserve funding to support a portion, or all, of any premium increase above twelve (12) percent.
In the event the premium increase in excess of twelve percent (12%) is not covered by PEBB reserves, the two percent (2%) salary schedule adjustment (12/01/2006) shall be reduced by onequarter of one percent (0.25%) for each one percent (1%) increase in insurance premiums above twelve percent (12%).
The parties may also jointly petition the PEBB to continue to do as follows: Employees who live in counties where the PEBB considers there to be an insufficient number of preferred providers within the PPO network will receive the same level of benefits when they use a non-preferred provider as they would using a preferred provider.
Section 1 . Public Employees Retirement System (""PERS"") Members. For purposes of this Section 1 , ""employee"" means an employee who is employed by the State
on August 28, 2003 and who is eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Retirement Contributions. On behalf of employees, the State will continue to ""pick up"" the six percent (6%) employee contribution, payable pursuant to law. The parties acknowledge that various challenges have been filed that contest the lawfulness, including the constitutionality, of various aspects of PERS reform legislation enacted by the 2003 Legislative Assembly, including Chapters 67 (HB 2003) and 68 (HB 2004) of Oregon Laws 2003 (""PERS Litigation""). Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any party's rights, claims or defenses with respect to the PERS Litigation.
Section 2. Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan Pension Program Members. For purposes of this Section 2, ""employee"" means an employee who is employed by the State
on or after August 29, 2003 and who is not eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Contributions to Individual Account Programs. As of the date that an employee becomes a member of the Individual Account Program established by Section 29 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, and pursuant to Section 3 of that same chapter, the State will pay an amount equal to six percent (6%) of the employee's monthly salary, not to be deducted from the salary, as the employee's contribution to the employee's account in that program. The employee's contributions paid by the State under this Section 2 shall not be considered to be ""salary"" for the purposes of determining the
amount of employee contributions required to be contributed pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Section 3. Effect of Changes in Law (Other than PERS Litigation). In the event that the State's payment of a six percent (6%) employee contribution under Section
1 or under Section 2, as applicable, must be discontinued due to a change in law, valid ballot measure, constitutional amendment, or a final, non-appealable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction (other than in the PERS Litigation), the State shall increase by six percent (6%) the base salary rates for each classification in the salary schedules in lieu of the six percent (6%) pick-up. This transition shall be done in a manner to assure continuous payment of either the six percent (6%) contribution or a six percent (6%) salary increase.
For the reasons indicated above, or by mutual agreement, if the State ceases paying the applicable six percent (6%) pickup and instead provides a salary increase for eligible bargaining unit employees during the term of the Agreement, and bargaining unit employees are able, under thenexisting law, to make their own six percent (6%) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program account, as applicable, such employees' contributions shall be treated as ""pre-tax"" contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Section 414(h)(2).
Section 4. Salary Adjustments. a. Effective January 1 , 2006, salary rates will be adjusted upward by two percent (2%). b. Effective January 1 , 2006, Correctional Officers, Corporals and Sergeants shall receive
a one-and-one-quarter percent (1.25%) market adjustment. c. Effective December 1 , 2006, Compensation Plan salary rates shall be increased by two
percent (2%). d. Effective July 1 , 2006, an additional step shall be added to all salary ranges.
Implementation shall be on a least cost basis. Employees who have been at the top step of their salary range on the effective date shall have their former salary eligibility date restored for future increases. This does not apply to anyone red circled above new top step.
Section 5. Recoupment of Wage and Benefit Overpayments/Underpayments. a. Overpayments. In the event that an employee receives wages or benefits from the
Agency to which the employee is not entitled, regardless of whether the employee knew or should have known of the overpayment, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment which will include information supporting that an overpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. For purposes of recovering overpayments by payroll deduction, the following shall apply.
1. The employee with or without Union representation and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty (30) calendar days following written notification. The employee, with or without Union representation and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty (30) days following written notification.
2. If there is no mutual agreement at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period the Agency shall implement the repayment schedule stated in subsection 3 below.
3. If the overpayment amount to be repaid is more than five percent (5%) of the employee's regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly amounts not exceeding five percent (5%) of the employee's regular base salary. If an overpayment is less than five percent (5%) of the employee's regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in a lump sum deduction from the employee's paycheck. If an employee leaves Agency service before the Agency fully recovers the overpayment, the remaining amount may be deducted from the employee's final check(s).
4. Subsections 1-3 of this Section shall not apply to payroll adjustments necessitated by a discrepancy between actual hours of paid time versus hours projected for payroll purposes from one pay period to another. For example, if an employee utilizes leave without pay near the end of a month but is paid for such time because such leave without pay was not anticipated at the
13
payroll cutoff date for that month, the employee's pay and benefit entitlements may be adjusted on the following month's paycheck.
5. The Agency shall not attempt to correct any overpayment to employees discovered older than two (2) years from notification.
b. Underpayments. In the event the employee does not receive the wages or benefits to which the record/documentation has for all times indicated the employer agreed the employee was entitled, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the underpayment. This notification will include information showing that an underpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. The Agency shall correct any such underpayment made within a maximum period of two (2) years before the notification.
c. This provision shall not apply to claims disputing eligibility for payments which result from this agreement. Employees claiming eligibility for such things as leadwork, work out-ofclassification pay or reclassification must pursue those claims pursuant to the timelines elsewhere in this Agreement.
Section 1 . Employees shall be eligible for annual performance pay increases on the employees' eligibility
date provided the employee is not at the top step of the salary range of the employees' classification. The employee may be denied the annual performance pay increase if there has been a serious performance or attendance problem. Denials are subject to review within six (6) months. Denials may be grieved under the provisions of Article 51.
Effective January 1 , 2006 step increases shall resume pursuant to the terms of the agreement at the time of each eligible employee's salary eligibility date.
Section 2. Any employee requiring an emergency draw shall be authorized once during the term of this
Agreement to make such a draw without explanation. Additional draws may be requested in accord with existing policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Section 3. Submission of Salary Increases. Salary increases must be made to be effective on the first day of the month and must be
submitted prior to the proposed effective date. However, salary increases to correct errors or oversights and retroactive payments resulting from grievance settlements will be authorized. The effective date for annual salary increases shall be on the employee's salary eligibility date. In no event shall any retroactivity exceed twelve (12) months from the date upon which the oversight or error is brought to management's attention in writing, or, in the case of a grievance settlement, the date the grievance was filed in writing.
Section 4. Salary on Promotion. An employee shall be given an increase to the next higher rate in the new salary range effective
on the date of the promotion and on the first of the month following completion of trial service after promotion and annually thereafter until employee has reached the top step of the salary range.
Section 5. Salary on Demotion. Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range that has a salary rate
the same as the previous step, the employee's salary shall be maintained at that step in the lower range.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a salary range which does not have salary steps corresponding with the employee's previous salary but is within the new salary range, the employee's salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the
employee's next eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one (1) full step within the new salary range plus that amount that their current salary is below the next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range, but the employee's previous salary is above the highest step for that range, the employee shall be paid at the highest step in the new salary range.
This Section shall not apply to demotions resulting from official disciplinary actions.
Section 6. Effect of Break in Service. When an employee separates from State service and subsequently returns to the State service
(except as a temporary employee), the employee's salary eligibility date shall be determined by the Agency as follows:
a. Return from Layoff List. When a former employee who was laid off is recalled, the employee will be paid at the step they were at the time of layoff. Employee's previous salary eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall be restored.
b. Return from Reemployment. When a former employee is reemployed to a position in the same class in which the employee was previously employed or in a related class with the same salary range, the employee may be paid at or below the step at which the employee was being paid at the time of termination. If an employee is reemployed in a position in a class with a lower salary range than that of the employee's previous position, the employee may be paid at any step in the lower salary range not exceeding the rate the employee was being paid in the higher class, except where exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate. The previous eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall represent the earliest salary eligibility date following return. However, the salary eligibility date may be established by the Agency as the first of the month in any future month up to twelve (12) months from date of reemployment.

Section 3. When a work site or duty station is also an employee's private residence during off duty hours,
time spent at home shall be considered on-call only when the following conditions exist: a. The Agency Appointing Authority or designated representative requires that an employee be restricted to a work site or duty station for a specific period of time; and b. The employee is required and must be prepared to commence full-time work if the need arises.
Section 4. An employee shall not be on call once the employee actually commences performing assigned
duties and receive the appropriate rate of pay for time worked.
Section 5. No employee is eligible for any premium pay compensation while on call except as expressly
stated in this Article.

Employer notifies the employee otherwise.
ARTICLE 20 - WORK OUT OF CLASSIFICATION
Section 1 . When an employee is assigned in writing for a limited period to perform the duties of a position
at a higher level classification for more than five (5) consecutive calendar days, the employee shall be compensated for all hours worked beginning from the first day of the assignment for the full period of the assignment at a rate which is not less than the equivalent of a one (1)-step increase, or the bottom step of the higher range when no salary overlap exists between ranges.
Section 2.
18
An employee performing duties out of classification for training or developmental purposes shall be informed in writing of the purpose and length of the assignment during which there shall be no extra pay for the work. A copy of the notice shall be placed in the employee's file.
Section 3. An employee who is underfilling a position shall be informed in writing of their underfill status,
the reasons for the underfill, and the requirements necessary for the employee to qualify for reclassification to the allocated level. Upon gaining regular status and meeting the requirements for the allocated level of the position, the employee shall be reclassified.
Section 4. Assignments of work out-of-classification shall not be made in a manner which will subvert or
circumvent the administration of this Article. This higher class work will be entered into the employee's personnel file and shall be used for annual performance appraisals and will be taken into consideration by supervisors during promotional merit ratings.
ARTICLE 21 - LEADWORK DIFFERENTIAL
Section 1 . Leadwork differential shall be defined as a differential for employees who have been formally
assigned by their supervisor, in writing, ""leadwork"" duties over three (3) or more employees in their classification or salary range for ten (10) consecutive calendar days or longer. Leadwork is where, on a recurring daily basis, while performing essentially the same duties as the workers led, the employee has been directed to perform substantially all of the following functions: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance to standards; and provide informal assessment of workers' performance to the supervisor.
Section 2. The differential shall be five percent (5%) beginning from the first day the duties were formally
assigned in writing for the full period of the assignment.
Section 3. Leadwork differential shall not be computed at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) for the time
worked in an overtime or holiday work situation, or to effect a ""pyramiding"" of work out-of- classification payment.
Section 4. Leadwork differential shall not apply for voluntary training and development purposes which are
mutually agreed to in writing between the supervisor and the employee.
Section 5. The employee who believes they are performing the duties of a leadworker as defined in
Section 1 , may request a review of the duties as follows: a. The employee shall notify their supervisor and appropriate Personnel Officer, in writing for a review. b. The supervisor, on behalf of the Agency, will respond to the employee in writing, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of notification. c. If it is the Agency's determination that the leadwork duties were assigned, the leadwork differential will be effective the date the employee notified the supervisor. d. If the Agency determines that the duties are not leadworker or wishes to remove the duties, the employee will be notified as noted in ""b"" of this Article.

ARTICLE 22 - TRAVEL AND MOVING EXPENSE Section 1 .
--
and end at 12:00 Midnight the following Saturday. All permanent full-time employees in the unit shall be scheduled for five (5) shifts of eight (8)
hours and two (2) consecutive days off within each workweek, or four (4) shifts of ten (10) hours and three (3) consecutive days off within each workweek. Saturday and Sunday will be considered as consecutive days off within the workweek.
b. Workweek Adjustments. If a variance from this paragraph is required in order to accomplish the mission of the Institution, the Agency shall notify the Union of the reasons for the change prior to its effective date and the Union shall be afforded an opportunity to comment and offer alternative suggestions. If the Union feels the change is unreasonable, the matter may be processed as a grievance.
Section 2. Working Hours.
a. Work Hours Defined. The standard workday shall be a period of twenty-four (24) hours,
containing eight (8) or ten (10) consecutive hours of work interrupted by rest and meal periods.
b. Rest Periods. Rest periods will normally consist of two (2), fifteen (15) minute breaks.
Rest periods preferably will occur between the second (2nd) and third (3rd) hours and the fifth (5th)
and sixth (6th) hours of the employee's shift. However, it is understood that breaks are not guaranteed
at regular and recurring intervals. Management agrees to make reasonable effort to allow rest breaks
where possible, but does not guarantee that breaks will be granted on every work shift or that they will
occur at regular and recurring intervals.
c.
Security & Recreation staff. Where security and recreation staff have a past practice
allowing informal breaks to occur, that practice shall continue on a reasonable basis consistent with
Section 2b above.

a. Work Schedule Bidding. 1. Employees may submit their bid for a shift and days off work schedule following
the posting of the work schedule by the Agency. The Agency will post the work schedule for bidding twenty-five (25) calendar days prior to the rotation date. Following the posting of the work schedule for each bid rotation period, the process for bidding will commence on the Monday following the posting as specified in this Article. The Agency will post a list of times and dates for each staff member to bid. This does not preclude an employee from bidding in advance of their scheduled time but their bid(s) will not be posted by the Agency until the time indicated on the bidding form for each employee. The new work schedule for each bid period shall be posted no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the rotation date. Employees will submit their bid to the Shift Commander in seniority order each thirty (30) minutes until all employees have the opportunity to bid. The parties shall meet to review the mechanics of the bidding procedure.

Employees assigned as work crew supervisors may volunteer for these alternate schedules at the time of the bid on the bid sheet in order to help carry out the inmate work program mission of the Agency. The Agency shall first assign employees who are assigned as work crew supervisors and who volunteer to change their work schedule between a 5-8 work schedule and a 4-10 work schedule before a change in schedule is made. If there are not sufficient employees who volunteer to move between these schedules during the bid period as needed by the Agency in carrying out its inmate work program mission, employees assigned to these duties may be assigned to a 4-10 schedule in reverse seniority order for a period of time during the bid as needed to carry out the work program needs of the Agency. The Agency will revert any affected employee(s) back to their bid shift and days off work schedule when the employee has completed the 4-10 work schedule assignment.

ARTICLE 44 - LAYOFF PROCEDURE
Section 1 . A layoff is defined as a separation from service for involuntary reasons not reflecting discredit
on an employee. An employee shall be given written notice of a pending layoff at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date stating the reason for the layoff.
Section 2. Employees shall be laid off and service credits calculated within the following mutually exclusive
categories: a. Full-time, b. Part-time (including job share).
Section 3. Layoff shall be by classification as defined in Section 11. The classification, geographic area,
and functional unit to be affected by any particular layoff shall be identified by the Agency at the time the layoff is declared. Order of layoff within the designated classification, functional unit, and geographic area shall be determined by the lowest service credit.
It is understood that when an employee who is to be laid off possesses knowledge, skill, or ability, the loss of which in the judgment of the Agency would seriously impact operations, the Agency may hold that employee in active status, while laying off the next employee in service credit order in the employee's stead. When it is necessary to hold an employee, who would otherwise be laid off, the Agency will document the need and such documentation shall be accessible to the Union for its review. Any dispute in this regard may be taken up as a grievance by the Union.
If an employee is underfilling a position, the employee will be considered in the higher classification for the purposes of this Article. If it is found that two (2) or more employees in the
43
Agency in which the layoff is to be made have equal service credits, the order of layoff shall be in inverse order of the greatest length of continuous State service. If ties between employees still exist, the order of layoff shall be determined by the Appointing Authority in such a manner as to conserve for the State the services of the most qualified employees.
Section 4. Service Credit. Seniority is defined as total length of continuous Agency service. One (1) point shall be allowed
for each full month of unbroken service. An employee's seniority shall be computed from the date of the employee's employment by the Agency in any capacity within the Division/Department, except that a new employee shall be on trial service for the appropriate period. A new employee shall be placed on the seniority list and given seniority ratings as of the first day the employee was hired by the Agency.
Seniority shall be forfeited if an employee has a break in service from the Agency of more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, other than layoff, or fails to respond within five (5) consecutive work days after receiving notice by registered letter mailed to the last address on the Agency's records, unless prevented from responding by conditions beyond the employee's control. A break in service is a separation or interruption of employment without pay of more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days.
Seniority lists shall be prepared by the Agency, during January, updated periodically, and posted on bulletin boards in the Agency. Time with the Board of Parole and the Department of Corrections shall be interchangeable. Time spent by former employees of the EOH&TC who were employed at that facility and transferred to EOCI within six (6) months of EOH&TC's closure, shall count toward the calculation of Department of Corrections seniority in that geographic area only.
Section 5. Options in Lieu of Layoff. Any employee who is given notice of layoff may file a written request to exercise an option in
lieu of layoff with the Appointing Authority within five (5) work days of receipt of such notice. The employee's options shall be as follows:
a. Any employee notified of layoff may opt to displace the least service credit person in the geographic area in the same classification provided the employee can perform the specific requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks.
b. Any employee notified of layoff may elect to demote within the functional unit to a lower classification for which the employee is qualified provided the employee can perform the requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks, if a position exists which is not protected from layoff and where the incumbent has the least seniority.
c. If no such option exists within the functional unit, the employee may elect to displace the least senior undesignated person in the geographic area in a lower classification for which the employee is qualified, provided the employee can perform the requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks.
Section 6. The name of a demoting employee shall then be placed on the appropriate layoff list for the
class the employee demoted from. Any employee demoted in lieu of layoff may request at that time and shall be paid for all accrued compensatory time at the rate being earned prior to demotion in lieu of layoff.

Any period of time beyond one (1) day necessary for purposes of readjustment shall be determined by the employee's physician or psychiatrist subject to verification by a physician or psychiatrist of the Agency's choice.
Section 2. Such leave shall be charged against any accumulated time the employee has earned; however,
where an employee is receiving compensation through Workers' Compensation or other victim compensation relief, such charges will be on a pro rata basis not to exceed the employee's regular salary (except staff assaults as defined in Article 33, Section 8).
Section 3. Where an employee who has established a good work record develops improper work habits or
excessive absenteeism, which may be evidence of job stress, the Agency shall attempt to establish the reasons behind the employee's poor work habits and shall counsel with the employee in an attempt to aid the employee in developing a program to begin improving those habits. Any admissions of the employee of wrong doing, which are brought out during such counseling sessions, shall not later be used against the employee in any subsequent disciplinary procedure unless otherwise proven.

An example of anticipated need would be knowledge of scheduled surgery and recovery period for which the teacher did not have enough accrued sick leave to cover the illness in ques-tion.
35-2-3-4 When Long-Term Disability Insurance applies:
When a teacher applies for, and is eligible to receive, Long-Term Disa-bility Insurance coverage, that teacher may utilize available accrued sick leave to carry the teacher's regular salary until the Long-Term Disability coverage would apply. If the teacher still has a balance of accrued sick leave days at the time the Long-Term Disability Insurance becomes effective, the unused portion of accrued sick leave will be reserved for future use, after the teacher returns to work from using Long-Term Disability Insurance.
There is a one hundred twenty (120) calendar day waiting period from the time application is made until Long-Term Disability Insurance becomes effective. If the teacher does not have enough
http://jeffcowebjeffco.kl2xo.us/emprelations/jcea/article_35.html

accrued sick leave to cover the illness during this waiting period, the teacher may apply for Extended Sick Leave coverage, and, if eligible, will be granted up to a maximum of sixty (60) days of Extended Sick Leave, depending upon the individual teacher's eligibility to draw from Extended Sick Leave, in order to provide the teacher with regular salary during the illness, except as provided in Section 35-2-3-1 -(C).

The Jefferson County Public Schools and Association are committed to retain and support the visual arts, music and physical education teacher concept at the elementary level. Teachers in the instructional areas of visual art, music, and physical education are provided because they:
1. have proven educational expertise in their fields; 2. provide quality experiences in the subject areas meeting student, District, and community expectations; 3. take best advantage of the instructional time available in these subject areas to provide quality experiential learning; 4. encourage students' creative and aesthetic growth; 5. provide students with safe and proper activities for physical and skill
development; 6. and provide expertise in the safe handling and utilization of various types of equipment, instruments, tools, mediums, and materials
available in the programs.
The regular classroom teacher, normally, does not have the educational background or interest in these areas sufficient to carry out the sophisticated programs in place in Jefferson County Public Schools.
The purpose of these goals is to establish standards for the assignment of elementary visual arts, music and physical education teachers. These goals strive for equity throughout the District regarding teaching loads, frequency of class contact, and length of contact sessions to meet the standards of Board policy relative to the instructional day.
These goals are to be utilized by area administrators and principals as goals for elementary visual arts, music and physical education program implementation effective August, 1995. In the event that an unexpected increase in pupil enrollment or a lack of facilities dictates that these goals cannot be honored, area administrators and principals will take note and initiate adjustments as soon as educationally feasible.
1. Insofar as possible, the goals will be to assign eighteen (18) sections per teacher. *Note: Class size relief may be applied for if the number of sections exceeds nineteen (19).
2. To the extent possible, class size of the visual arts, music and physical education teacher should be consistent with the teaching load of a classroom teacher within the building.
3. Special education students who are mainstreamed into visual art, music, and physical education should be integrated in a manner consistent with the regular classroom. When it is most appropriate educationally to maintain a group of special education students as a separate class in visual arts, music, and physical education, this group shall be counted as a section for the visual arts, music and physical education teachers.
4. There should be time allowed for travel between schools as determined by the principal and area administrator. 5. Expectations for special programs are identified in Key Features documents and other program materials.
When visual arts, music and physical education teachers are assigned to two (2) schools, adjustments are needed regarding expectations for performances, exhibits, and other identified program, as well as time to travel, set up, put away and plan, in order to meet instructional needs at each site. The yearly school calendars should be coordinated in a meeting of the principals and the visual arts, music and physical education teachers involved.

CDM recognizes that there are different types of decisions:
--
Allocation of Resources: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Interviewing, selecting and recognizing employees and volunteers; recruiting volunteers; budget development, expenditures and evaluation; grant writing and the use of community and volunteer resources.
Governance and Management: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Room assignments, facility management, support services, transportation, field trips, discipline plan, extra-curricular activities, student progress reporting procedures, scheduling, community relations and communications.
Requests from the site for variances and memoranda of understanding will be reviewed at both the work site and within the articulation areas, as well as by representatives of appropriate State agencies, Board of Education, District administration, employee organizations and community groups. A procedure has been established for seeking variances from the JCEA R-1 Master Agreement.
V. STANDARDS FOR THE CO-OOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
The following standards and questions are designed to assist in the establishment and ongoing assessment of your co-operative decisionmaking process: Schools/work sites are in various stages of development in their practice of CDM and may use these accordingly.
1. The participants are broadly representative of the school community.
--
existing committees, restructure existing committees, create a new entity, or any combination to meet the defined co-operative decisionmaking standards for their site. 4. Adopt and implement a scope and authority model (who will decide what). 5. Develop method for selecting CDM participants. 6. Plan and provide training for key stakeholders.
Examples and detailed descriptions of how sites have used co-operative decision-making, appointed selected participants, and structured their process are described in the ""Co-Operative Decision-Making Resource Book."" The Resource Book also includes samples of operating rules, process descriptions and membership structures of existing co-operative decision-making systems. Copies of the resource book will be available in conjunction with the self-assessment video that the Task Force will provide. (See page 7.)
Step Two: Implementation of Site CDM Plan
1. Formalize goals and objectives. 2. Continue training for stakeholders participating in the program. 3. Revisit scope and authority model. 4. Provide ongoing evaluation of program.
VII SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE
As the District moves toward the full implementation of a co-operative decision-making process, schools/work sites will require support to understand how this process can best meet the needs of the school/work site. To provide this support, a team of trained facilitators will be made available to assist these schools/work sites. District employees, parents and volunteers who have demonstrated an ability to provide positive leadership for the co-operative decision-making process will be recruited as facilitators.
In addition to support and assistance from trained facilitators, there will be a process review to assess the effectiveness of CDM on a Districtwide basis. A Coordinating Committee will be structured to provide this process review.
Site Evaluation
A critical first step in implementing co-operative decision-making in the District will be the identification of a CDM process at each school/work site. This report recommends providing support to participants of training and technical assistance. The Co-Operative Decision-Making (CDM) Task Force will produce an interactive video that will assist all schools/work sites in a self-assessment to determine where they are in the process and what needs to be done. After viewing the video and completing the self-assessment, schools/work sites will determine training needs and utilize their allocation from the CDM funds identified by the Board.
Schools and work sites will also receive a CDM Resource Book that will contain samples from other schools and districts, and a list of resources for assistance and support.
At the conclusion of each year, each school/site will be required to complete a form reporting on how assistance was used as well as the effectiveness of co-operative decision-making efforts. The form will ask for signatures of each participant serving at the school/site.

Support and Assistance by Local Facilitators
Page 5 of 7
The District will create a Co-Operative Decision-Making Support Team by training volunteers who will be willing to assist sites on an ""as-called"" basis. Volunteers will include teachers, administrators, classified employees, parents, students and others who currently use co-operative decision-making at their site.
To create the pool of facilitators, the following organizations should be asked to solicit volunteers for this task. Following training, the names will be compiled for distribution to each school/site council:
Jefferson County Education Association. Jefferson County Administrators Association. Classified School Employees Association. Student Councils. Parent Teacher Association. District Accountability Committee. Volunteers/seniors active in the District.
District CDM Coordinating Committee
A Coordinating Committee will be created with two assigned responsibilities:
Review of site appeals.
District co-operative decision-making assessment.
The Coordinating Committee will meet a minimum of twice a year, mid-year and at the end of the school year, to evaluate progress in cooperative decision-making efforts throughout the District. To conduct this review, the Committee will use the data from the feedback provided by sites at the end of the year.
The second function proposed for the Coordinating Committee is to provide an appeals process for schools/sites. The Coordinating Committee should be composed of Board of Education appointees and representatives of JCEA, JCAA, CSEA District Accountability, Parent/Teacher/Student Associations, volunteers and community organizations.
When presented with an appeal, the Coordinating Committee, using the standards set for all schools/sites, will determine if the appeal is a cooperative decision-making issue. It is not the purpose of the Coordinating Committee to review site decisions, but to assist in assuring a cooperative process has taken place.
The Coordinating Committee members may be expected to gather appropriate data prior to convening meetings. Coordinating Committee meetings will be convened to review appeals, to collect information from all parties and to respond with suggestions for process improvement.
Co-operative decision-making is a process designed to encourage involvement for mutual benefit. It is the expectation of the Board of Education that the process be developed within each school and department. The purpose of the District Co-Operative Decision-Making Coordinating Committee is to assure that such a process is in place and to assist in facilitating the process where possible. The issues and procedures used in co-operative decision-making will always be within the limitations of Board of Education policies and procedures, negotiated agreements, and State laws.

2. Arbitration may be initiated by the grieving party by serving notice upon the other party requesting arbitration within fifteen (15) duty days and setting forth the precise question it proposes to arbitrate, the section of the Agreement violated, and a description of the action taken that initiated the grievance.

Article 13 Working Hours And Work Load
A. The regularly scheduled work week shall not exceed five (5) days. The regularly scheduled workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours in addition to a duty-free lunch period. Starting and dismissal times will be assigned by the principal or the appropriate director. However, no change in starting and dismissal times in excess of two (2) hours will be made without the concur rence of the Union and the affected unit member. This limitation will not apply where the entire shift of the position assignment is changed.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing employees in the bargaining unit who work less than eight (8) hours per day and forty (40) hours per week the opportunity to work an optimal number of hours per week consistent with the operating needs and efficiency of the school system.
B. Except for bus operators and bus attendants, the workday for forty-hour per week unit members shall consist of eight (8) hours of work within eight and one-half (8) consecutive hours. The workday for unit members working less than forty (40) hours shall also consist of regularly scheduled consecutive working hours exclusive of duty-free lunch periods when applicable.

35
D. 1. A unit member who is requested by an appropriate official to report back to work after the unit member's normal workday or to report to work on a nonscheduled workday shall be credited with a minimum of three (3) hours of work. However, time worked immediately before or immediately after the unit member's regularly scheduled hours is not considered call back work and only the actual work time is reported.
2. When an unit member is directed in writing by a supervisor to remain at home and be ready to report for work when called, that unit member shall receive three (3) additional hours straight time pay for each day on such standby basis.
E. 1. In regard to system-wide delayed opening, only the school-based unit members in the following classifications will begin work twenty (20) minutes before the scheduled student starting time on said day without loss of pay:

3. The principal of any school may require any unit member in Section E.l to be on duty for the normal duty day if he/she is needed. Only the principal will determine such need.
F. If the entire school system, including the central office is closed at the order of the superintendent, those employees who are required to work on an emergency basis will be paid at their applicable straight time rate for the hours they work while the system is closed. This payment will be over and above the payment they would have received had they not been required to work. Where schools are closed after food service employees report to work, they will be paid at the applicable straight time rate for the hours worked, in addition to emergency leave as provided in Article 12, Section O.
G. School-based unit members and maintenance employees who are required to report to work at the beginning of their shift or remain at work until the end of their shift on days of delayed opening and early closing of schools shall receive one (1) hour pay in addition to their regular pay. It is understood this
36
additional payment to maintenance employees will apply only when the required work to be performed is related to the reasons for the delayed opening or early closing.
H. Ten-month food service employees, educational assistants, media assistants, and office employees will be notified by the closing of the school year of their next year's starting date and assignment, subject to the right of MCPS to make changes in such assignments whenever circumstances require, especially in the case of educational assistants.
I. The duties or work required of a unit member will not be increased unreason ably above those normally required because of staff shortages or schedule reductions.

Volunteers will not be used to take over the duties of any unit member. MCPS shall provide the Union annually a report on the status of the volunteer program to be submitted by the coordinator of volunteers.
Article 15 Reduction In Force
A. Authority--The Board of Education of Montgomery County retains the right to reduce its force, and its decisions on such reduction are not subject to the grievance procedure.

C. Definition--Reduction in force shall mean an action resulting in a unit member being terminated from Montgomery County Public Schools for reasons other than disciplinary.
37
D. Procedure for Reduction--When a reduction in staff within a given classi fication occurs, the determination of those who are to be released will be in the following order
1. Probationary employees to be laid off first.
2. If further reductions are needed, those unit members with less than four (4) years' service whose two (2) most recent performance evaluations have been unacceptable and/or below average will be laid off next.
3. If still further reductions are required, seniority (as defined below) will govern, with the least senior unit member to be laid off first.
The foregoing procedure will be applied on a system-wide basis and seniority is defined as length of continuous service with the Montgomery County Public Schools.
E. Recall 1. Unit members whose services have been terminated because of a reduc tion in staff shall for a period of two (2) years receive priority consider ation for reemployment if they so desire and when Montgomery County Public Schools decides to fill vacancies. The recall will be in the inverse order of force reduction. If a unit member is notified of recall to a reasonably approximate position for which the unit member qualifies and refuses the assignment, the unit member will lose the right to further recall.
2. In the event that a unit member does not desire at the time of termination to be placed on the list for priority consideration he/she shall receive full payment for all earned unused sick leave and will lose the right to recall. For those terminated unit members having two (2) full years of service but less than six (6) years of service, they will receive, in addition, one-half month's salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public Schools' service. For those terminated unit members having six (6) or more years of service, they will receive, in addition, one month's salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public School's service up to a limit of twelve (12) months' salary.
F. Any unit member who is terminated due to a reduction in force may be placed on leave without pay for the six (6) months immediately following the last duty day and may choose to continue membership in the MCPS health benefit plan in which th j unit member is enrolled by paying the full cost of membership in such plan during those six months. If the member is not recalled, or refuses an assignment before the end of the initial six-month period, the leave without pay and the membership in the MCPS health benefit plan is automatically termi nated.
38
G. A nonbargaining unit employee may not exercise seniority rights to bump into or be placed in a MCCSSE bargaining unit classification during a time of a RIF affecting that classification or while there are unit members on active recall status who are eligible for work in such classification.
H. It is the goal of the parties to avoid layoff of unit members to the extent possible. The superintendent will attempt to provide a period of retraining for nonprobationary unit members so that they can be placed in positions for which they would not otherwise qualify without such training.
I. Any action taken under the foregoing provisions, except for the decision referred to in Section A, shall be grievable under Article 6 .
Article 16 Position Descriptions
A. Upon request, each unit member will be provided with an accurate description of his/her duties or responsibilities in the form of a class specification.
B. A copy of a unit member's class specification will be included in each employment package to be distributed during orientation.
C. Any unit member dissatisfied with an adverse reclassification which results in a pay reduction or downgrading may appeal direcdy to the superintendent whose decision shall be final. A unit member assigned to a lower grade classification as a result of a reclassification will be placed on the lower pay grade without reduction in pay. When the same rate of pay does not exist in the lower pay grade, the unit member's hourly rate of pay will be red-circled which will remain in effect for no more than three (3) years from the effective date of the reclassification action. The unit member's anniversary date for step increases will not be affected.
D. The MCCSSE shall be notified in advance when a classification action is to be taken which reduces the pay or pay grade of a unit member.
E. Upon the request of MCCSSE, and at mutually agreeable times, a member of the classification staff will meet with a representative of MCCSSE to discuss classification matters.
Article 17 Discipline And Discharge
A. A suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary action may only be taken against unit members for proper cause.

B. Any suspension of a unit member for the purpose of investigation shall be with full pay. Normally, such investigations will be completed within five (5) duty days.
C. Written notice of charges with specifications will be given to the affected unit member at the time the disciplinary action is taken. Prior to acting upon a recommendation for discharge or suspension in excess of five (5) duty days, the deciding official shall offer the affected employee the opportunity to make a statement in his/her behalf personally or in writing. Where the employee elects to make the statement in person to the deciding official, a MCCSSE representative may be present.
Article 18 Dues Checkoff
A. As unit members individually and voluntarily authorize the Board of Educa tion of Montgomery County, the Board agrees to withhold organizational dues or agency fee and other properly authorized deductions from the unit member's wages and to transmit such funds to the MCCSSE headquarters. The Board will include the name, the school, office or department where the unit member is located, and the amount of each deduction.

C. The amount deducted from a unit member's wages during the term of this Agreement will be for the total dues, and each individual must authorize the deduction by authorization form signed by the unit member that such deduc tions shall be at the current rate.

If this certification is not received by the Division of Payroll, no deduction will be made.
D. The right of dues checkoff in this article shall be granted exclusively to MCCSSE.
E. MCCSSE shall indemnify and save the Board harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or any other forms of liability that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Board for the purposes of complying with any list, notice, form, card, or assignment furnished under any such provisions.

Discipline shall only be imposed for violation of an expressed rule, an expressed order, an expressed policy or a reasonable expectation of management which reasonably should have been known to the teacher. This shall not be construed so as to prohibit the principal from questioning a teacher and/or offering reasonable direction at the time of the occurrence of any incidents the result of which might later be dealt with in a disciplinary manner. 3. Teachers shall not be required or permitted to discipline other teachers. 4 . Teachers shall be entitled to representation in any meeting with the administration when the employee reasonably feels that discipline may result. 5. On matters that may result in discipline, the teacher m ay choose not to m ake a statement or explain his perception of the facts. This shall not be construed as an admission of guilt. 6 . T he Superintendent may also suggest either independently or in consultation with the Association that the affected teacher enroll in the Employee Assistance Program. 7. In the event the teacher cannot be reached during any period of time when the teacher is not required to be on duty, no disciplinary action shall be initiated until he is required to be on duty, or he has received actual notification or a reasonable attempt at notification of the proposed action has been made. Notice by certified mail at the last known address of the teacher shall be considered a reasonable attempt. 8 . W hen any State agency is contacted by the administration pursuant to this Article, the affected teacher and the Association shall be notified.
B. Reprimands 1. Oral Reprimands If after an investigation the decision to impose discipline is to issue an oral reprimand, the reprimand shall be given in private and shall be done in a formal discussion. 2.

If a written reprimand is being given to the teacher, it shall be issued within ten (1 0 ) duty days of the initial formal conference unless witnesses named by the teacher are unavailable. T he time limits m ay also be extended by mutual consent. e. A teacher may, within twenty (2 0 ) duty days after receipt of a letter of reprimand, file a statement of reaction which shall be attached to the reprimand and remain in the teacher's file as long as the letter of reprimand remains. f. A written reprimand shall not serve as prima facie evidence of the facts alleged therein in any later hearing, where a suspension or dismissed of the teacher is recommended. g. Any written reprimand shall contain the statement that the letter shall be removed from the teacher's file if there are no similar problems for a specified period of time which shall not exceed two (2 ) years. C. Dismissal 1. Preliminary Procedures a. T h e following procedures shall be used prior to the filing of any formal written charges against a teacher for immorality, misconduct in office, gross insubordination, willful neglect of duty, drunkenness, or conviction of any crime involving moral turpitude: (1 ) T he Superintendent shall direct a fair and objective
investigation of the alleged misconduct or other basis for potential action. (2 ) T he affected teacher shall be informed verbally of the circumstances leading to the investigation and shall be informed that he is not required to m ake a written or oral statement if he chooses not to do so. (3 ) During the course of the investigation and prior to a decision to file formal charges, the Superintendent or his designee may relieve a teacher from duty, provided that
30
he shall notify the teacher and the Association of his action in writing, and the reasons for taking action. Relief of duty shall be with pay, and is not disciplinary. It will not be a part of the teacher's personnel file, b. T he following procedures shall be used prior to the filing of formal written charges against a teacher for imcompetency: (1 ) T he teacher shall be notified of alleged deficiencies which, if not corrected, could lead to dismissal. The notice shall identify a tentative time frame for improvement and include a statement that failure to correct the alleged deficiencies may lead to dismissal. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be preceded by a conference or conferences to discuss the alleged deficiencies, recommendations for improvement, and assistance available in an effort to effect improvement. (2 ) Further explanation of alleged deficiencies and suggested corrections shall be provided to the teacher in a conference or conferences, the first of which shall be held within three (3 ) working weeks of the written notice. Following said conference(s), the teacher shall be provided a written statement of specific recommendations and assistance available for each major area of alleged deficiency. (3) Reasonable assistance shall be offered and provided in order to assist the teacher in correcting deficiencies. (4 ) A reasonable period of time not less than three (3) teaching months from the written statement required in b .(2 ) above shall be provided for correction of deficiencies.

If the Superintendent or his designee determines that an examination will be required, he shall notify the teacher in writing of the requirement. At all times, the choice from among state licensed physicians and psychiatrists shall be made by the teacher from a list provided by the Board. T he teacher shall have the right to seek an additional opinion or judgement from among state licensed physicians or psychiatrists at the teacher's choosing and at the teacher's cost. (9 ) T h e examination above may be waived and the Superintendent or his designee may rely upon the attending physician's assessment of the teacher's condition in extreme cases where incapacity is so severe as to render the examination without benefit or use. The Association shall be so informed and shall be provided an opportunity for representation prior to any further action in the matter. (1 0 ) A teacher alleged to be incompetent may be offered options in lieu of the Superintendent proceeding with documentation and charges against the teacher.

Following the explanation by the Superintendent or his designee, the teacher may explain his perception of the facts with respect to the allegations within a reasonable period of time. H e may explain or identify other sources of information including witnesses that may provide information concerning the allegations. T he Superintendent or his designee shall then
32
determine if further investigation is necessary or if formal written charges will be filed without further investigation and shall so notify the teacher of his decision.
3. Filing of Formal Charges a. At least one (1 ) week prior to the time that formal charges will be brought to the Board, the affected teacher and the Association shall be notified in writing of the charges, the Superintendent's recommendation to the Board, and the time that said charges will be brought to the Board. This time frame can be mutually waived by the Superintendent or his designee and the teacher or his representative. Notification shall also include depositions from witnesses, and the summary draft of the investigation, supporting the formal charges. b. T he Superintendent shall bring the charges before the Board at the next regular meeting. c. Upon receipt of formal written charges and a recommendation to dismiss, the Board may act on the recommendation. If the decision is to proceed, the Board may suspend the teacher with or without pay pending a speedy resolution of the charges. T he Board shall continue to provide insurance benefits to the teacher. d. Should the Board elect to suspend a teacher in accordance with the preceding section, the first forty-five (4 5 ) duty days of suspension following Board action shall be without pay unless the Board has requested an extension or has determined that the entire suspension shall be with pay. e. If a hearing is requested, it shall be conducted in accordance with Florida Statu tes Chapter 1 2 0 which is the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Chapter 120 hearing cannot be concluded within the first forty-five (4 5 ) duty days, a mutually agreeable alternative to the Chapter 1 2 0 hearing procedure may be established and followed. This alternative shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. f. If charges are not sustained, the teacher shall be immediately reinstated; his back salary shall be paid; and he shall be deemed to have been an employee during the period of suspension for purposes of employee benefits. g.

District-wide seniority and the certification of a teacher on the date of official Board action to reduce staff shall be the factors utilized in the lay-off procedures. 2. T he lay-off of teachers shall be carried out on a district-wide basis using the following sequence: a. district-wide attrition
b. temporary contract
c. temporary certificate
d. contractual status (1) annual contract (2 ) continuing contract including professional services contract
e. least district-wide seniority
f. degree status (priority given to higher degree)

No new teachers shall be hired in a subject area or at the elementary level before teachers who are laid-off from other areas and who may be qualified because of certification have been offered the position and have declined or failed to accept the position. 3. Continuing contract teachers shall be recalled first in inverse
34
order of lay-off. Annual contract teachers who have received a favorable recommendation from their principals shall then be recalled.

2 . T he Board shall encourage class sizes consistent with District goals, the nature of different subject matter, instructional objectives, the requirements of different instructional processes, the capacities of the physical facilities, state laws and regulations, and the special needs of students. However, teacher allocations shall be based upon the assumption that smaller classes are more critical to the teaching and learning processes in the primary grades, K -3. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as prohibiting very small classes of independent study or very large classes when the subject matter and the capacity of the learning area are appropriate for such large group instruction. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be interpreted as prohibiting the organization of individual classes, regardless of their total sizes, into smaller learning groups or into combinations of larger learning groups with other classes if such sizes of groups are determined to be the most appropriate learning arrangements to meet different instructional needs.
3 . T he Board shall establish appropriate guidelines and policy which shall include at least the following provisions: a. If an individual teacher feels a class(es) has an excessive number of students or the teaching load is excessive, he may request a meeting with the principal who will discuss the issue with the teacher and attempt to resolve it. b. If the matter cannot be resolved within two (2 ) weeks at the school level, it shall be referred by the principal to the Deputy Superintendent for Instruction or his designee who will within two (2 ) weeks assess the situation and make a recommendation which, in his judgment, best serves the interest of the school system. Said recommendation will be
39
made to the teacher and will state the reasons, c. During the months of October and February, agents of the
Board shall review reported class loads and shall investigate instances where such loads exceed adopted guidelines. Based upon their investigation, they shall take appropriate action in accordance with this section of the Contract.

On student contact days, in work locations where there is no lunchroom or in job assignments which permit flexible lunch scheduling, a teacher may be given approximately one (1 ) hour for lunch by mutual agreement with his immediate supervisor. If this occurs, the work day for the teacher m ay be proportionately extended to provide for equity with other teachers. This shall not be construed as a violation of Section A of this article. Q. Planning Time 1. All teachers shall have daily assigned planning time during which they shall not be responsible for students, in accordance with the following: a.

While planning time is intended for purposes of preparation, nothing herein shall preclude a teacher from using planning time for conferences with parents, administrators, or other teachers, or giving special assistance to students. 3 . A teacher shall not be restricted to remain in a particular area of the school during his planning time.
40
4 . Teachers who receive supplements for before and/or after school duty may not necessarily be guaranteed the planning time outlined above.
5 . A reasonable effort will be made by the building principal to provide a specific area for planning. If a specific area cannot be located the principal shall confer with the Deputy Superintendent for Instruction or his designee within one (1 ) week of the initial complaint, who will within two (2 ) weeks assess the situation and make a recommendation. T he recommendation shall be in writing with a copy to the teacher, principal, and the Association.
R. Principals will cooperate with teachers in making arrangements for a break in either the morning or afternoon. W hen vocational courses are taught in three (3 ) hour blocks and students are given a break, teachers shall be entitled to the same break. In schools where principals have not been able to facilitate breaks, teachers may utilize at least ten (1 0 ) minutes of their planning time or a reasonable amount of student passing time as a duty-free break.
S. Teachers shall attend faculty meetings as called by the principal. Any meetings called to solicit funds from teachers shall be pre-announced as to the meeting's purpose, and teacher attendance shall be voluntary. Except during pre-planning and post-planning, faculty meetings shall not exceed approximately one (1 ) hour per week, except for emergencies.
T . Required meetings or other required activities relating to the Beginning T eacher Program shall not infringe upon guaranteed teacher planning time or duty-free lunch of the peer teacher and of the beginning teacher.

In cases where the Apprentice has not qualified as a Journeyman at the end of the apprenticeship training period in the judgement of the Employer, such apprenticeship period may be extended an additional six (6) months and the Apprentice shall be paid at the Top Apprentice rate during this period.
