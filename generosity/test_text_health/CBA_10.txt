Such compensatory time shall not be accumulated in excess of one hundred and twenty hours and may be used in one half-hour increments. An appointing authority shall permit the use of compensatory time at the employee's request, provided the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operation of a department or agency. Upon termination an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the final regular rate of pay.
Section 7.3

C. Stand-by duty shall mean that a department head has ordered any employee to be immediately available for duty upon receipt of a message to report to work. If any employee assigned to stand-by duty is not available to report to duty when called, no stand-by pay shall be paid to the employee for the period.
D. Should a department head require coverage of a work location on a 24-hour basis, such department head will establish a list of employees to be available for duty. The least senior employee in the work location shall be first on the list. Having once been put on stand-by duty, the next junior employee will be placed on stand-by duty, etc. With the approval of the department, employees may substitute for one another under this Section.
E. Stand-by duty shall be voluntary except in the case of an emergency. There shall be no discrimination or discipline taken against any employee who declines stand-by in a non-emergency situation.

16
required to submit a medical certification, unless the appointing authority has reason to believe that the birth, adoption or placement claim was not genuine. This leave benefit shall be in addition to the ten (10) days of paid leave set forth in section 8.7A.7. Of the sixty (60) days per calendar year provided herein, an employee may use a maximum of ten (10) days per calendar year to attend to necessary preparations and legal requirements related to the employee's adoption of a child.

G. Any employee having no sick leave credits, who is absent due to illness, may be placed at the discretion of the appointing authority on vacation leave or leave without pay. Such leave shall be charged on the same basis as provided in subsection (F).
H. An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after an absence of less than three years shall be credited with his/her sick leave credits at the termination of his/her prior employment. An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after a period of three
17
years or more shall receive prior sick leave credits, if approved by the Personnel Administrator, where such absence was caused by:
(1) Illness of said employee;
(2) Dismissal through no fault or delinquency attributable solely to said employee; or,
(3) Injury while in the employment of the Commonwealth in the line of duty, and for which said employee would be entitled to receive Worker's Compensation benefits.

Such notice must include the general nature of the disability and the estimated period of time for which the employee will be absent. Where circumstances warrant, the Appointing Authority or designee shall reasonably excuse the employee from such daily notification.
K. Where the Appointing Authority has reason to believe that sick leave is being abused, the Appointing Authority may require satisfactory medical evidence from the employee. This request shall be reduced to writing and shall cite specific reasons for the request. When medical evidence is requested, such request shall be made as promptly as possible. To the extent possible, the employee shall receive prior notice that the Appointing Authority believes s/he is abusing sick leave and that s/he may be required to produce medical evidence for future use of sick leave.
In order to clarify existing practice, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by a licensed Physician, Physician's Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Chiropractor, or Dentist that he/she has personally examined the employee and shall contain the nature of the illness or injury, unless identified as being of a confidential nature; a statement that the employee was unable to perform his or her duties due to the specific illness or injury on the days in question; and a prognosis for the employee's return to work. In cases where the employee is absent due to a family or household illness or injury, as defined in Section 1(C)2 of this Article, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by medical personnel mentioned above indicating that the person in question has been determined to be seriously ill and needing care on the days in question. A medical statement provided pursuant to this Article shall be on the letterhead of the attending physician or medical
18
provider as mentioned above, and shall list an address and telephone number. Failure to produce such evidence within seven (7) days of its request may result, at the discretion of the Appointing Authority, in denial of sick leave for the period of absence.
L. In extraordinary circumstances, where the Appointing Authority, or the designated person in charge if the Appointing Authority is unavailable, has sufficient reason to believe that an employee has a mental or physical incapacity rendering him/her unfit to perform his/her job or which jeopardizes workplace safety or stability, the Appointing Authority or the designated person in charge may authorize the removal of such employee from the workplace. It is understood that the employee might not recognize or acknowledge such unfitness.
The employee shall be required to undergo a medical examination to determine his/her fitness for work. The employee, if he/she so desires, may be represented by a physician of his/her own choice, in which case such verification and cost shall be the responsibility of the employee. However, the Appointing Authority shall reserve the right to obtain a second opinion from a Commonwealth designated physician to determine fitness for work. Such cost shall be borne by the Appointing Authority.
M. No employee shall be entitled to a leave under the provisions of this Article in excess of the accumulated sick leave credits due such employee.
N. Employees whose service with the Commonwealth is terminated shall not be entitled to any compensation in lieu of accumulated sick leave credits. Employees who retire shall be paid twenty percent (20%) of the value of their unused accrued sick leave at the time of their retirement. Upon the death of an employee who dies while in the employ of the Commonwealth, twenty percent (20%) of the value of the unused sick leave which the employee had personally earned and accrued as of the time of death shall be paid in the following order of precedence, as authorized by the Personnel Administrator upon request of the Appointing Authority of the deceased employee: first, to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, lawfully designated by the employee under the state employees' retirement system; and second, if there be no such designated beneficiary, to the estate of the deceased. It is understood that any such payment will not change the employee's pension benefit.
O. Sick leave credits earned by an employee following a return to duty after a leave without pay or absence without pay shall not be applied to such period of time.
P. An employee who while in the performance of his/her duty receives bodily injuries resulting from acts of violence of patients or prisoners in his/her custody, and who as a result of such injury would be entitled to benefits under Chapter 152 of the General Laws, shall, if entitled under Chapter 30, Section 58 of the General Laws, be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he/she would be entitled under said
19
Chapter 152 and his/her regular salary without such absence being charged against available sick leave credits, even if such absence may be for less than six calendar days' duration.

Memorandum of Understanding Between the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
Massachusetts Organization of S tate Engineers and Scientists
Electronic Transfers
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through the Human Resources Division (HRD), and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, (MOSES), are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agree ment which provides for employees covered by the terms and conditions of the Agreement to have their salaries transferred electronically by means of direct deposit. Whereas MOSES has expressed concern that not all employees would be able to avail themselves of the electronic transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:
1 . The Commonwealth and MOSES agree that all employees will have their net salary checks electronically forwarded to an account or accounts selected by the employee;
2. In the extraordinary event that MOSES alleges that an employee cannot comply with the Collective Bargaining Agreement relative to the electronic transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or, there is not an ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employee's worksite or home, or in the case of domestic violence where a person purposely does not want to have an account for safety reasons, MOSES shall petition the Human Resources Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption;
3. The Human Resources Division, in concert with the Office of the State Comptroller, shall review the request for the Direct Deposit Special Exemption filed by MOSES and will notify MOSES of its finding;
4. The Parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or MOSES relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and further, that this Memorandum is not grievable and is inarbitrable.
The Provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be coterminous with the duration of this collective bargaining agreement as provided in Article 29.
99
Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists MBTA Passes
Contingent on compliance with all federal and state regulations, and as soon as is administratively feasible for the Employer, the Commonwealth agrees to deduct the cost of MBTA passes from an employee's salary on a pre-tax basis for all employees who wish to participate in such a program.
The Provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be coterminous with the duration of this collective bargaining agreement as provided in Article 29. Signed this 16th day of November, 1999.

PERSONAL & VACATION LEAVE
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into b etween the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through the Human Resources Division, and MOSES, Unit 9. The intent of this Memorandum of Understanding is to clarify the understanding reached by the parties concerning Article 8, Section 8.2., "Paid Personal Lea ve".
MOSES employees are encouraged to utilize any current unused personal leave balances before December 31, 1999. It is understood that the employees will receive three new personal days upon implementation of the HR/CMS payroll system, and that those three personal days will be available for use between the advent of HR/CMS and December 31, 2000. However, no employee will be allowed to carry more than three personal days at any given time. If an employee has exhausted his/her personal leave by January 1 , 2000, and said employee requires the use of personal leave before said implementation of HR/CMS, the Employer agrees to allow an employee to " draw" against their personal leave balance in advance of said implementation.
An employee's unused but forfe itable vacation time as of June 30, 2000 will not be forfeited as required by Article 9; rather said forfeiture shall not occur until December 31, 2000.
The provisions contained herein shall expire on December 31, 2000.
The terms of this Agreement shall not establish precedent with regard to any other matter.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS AND THE
MASSACHUSETTS ORGANIZATION OF
STATE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS
Regarding Essential Functions
--
2. DEFINITIONS
As used in this Code, unless the context requires otherwise:
--
This code is not to be considered all-inclusive. The absence of a specific published rule of conduct does not mean nor imply that any act of misconduct tending to discredit an employee is condoned or permissible or would not result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
3. Knowledge of Code
Each employee is required to know the Code of Conduct and rules contained herein, to seek information from his/her appointing authority, the appointing authority' s designee or personnel office in case of doubt or misunderstanding as to their application.
Decisions in personnel matters involving disciplinary action will be based on the presumption that each employee has familiarized himself/herself with this Code and that he or she is aware of the obligation to abide by it.
4. Effect of Code
Employees whose conduct does not conform to the rules and guidelines contained in this Code may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any disciplinary action taken will conform to civil service law and/or the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
5. Distribution of Code
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will see that each employee receives a copy of this Code. Employees will acknowledge receipt of the Code by signing the attached Receipt of Code Form (Form CC-3) in the space provided. In each instance, the signed Receipt Form will be returned to the employee' s appointing authority or his/her designee within ten days of receipt, and filed in the employee's personnel folder. The employee' s signature on the Receipt Form is notice of his/her obligation to familiarize himself/herself with the contents of the Code of Conduct and to abide by it.
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will be responsible for providing accurate information and guidance to his/her employees with regard to the specifics of the Code and may from time to time offer training sessions on the Code to his/her employees as the need arises.
108
6. Effective Date of Code
The effective date of the Code shall be ten days after the Code of Conduct is distributed and the Code of Conduct Receipt Form is received by the employee.
B. Conformance to Laws
Employees shall obey the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any employee who is convicted of a crime relating to his/her employment shall be subject to discipline.
Any employee who has been indicted or arrested for a serious crime, supported by a judicial finding of probable cause in a preliminary hearing when the nature of the charge with its attendant publicity reasonably gives rise to legitimate fear for the safety of other employees, the property of the Commonwealth, or jeopardizes the public trust in the ethical standards of agency/departmental employees or undermines the trust in the integrity of the Commonwealth's system of tax administration or the administration of other laws of the Commonwealth, may also be subject to suspension without pay or other employee benefits, pending resolution of the case.
If the employee is found not guilty, pleads nolo contendere, has his/her case continued without a finding, is granted immunity from prosecution or has his/her case filed, further disciplinary action, including termination, may be taken if the crime was related to his/her employment. If the employee is found not guilty, or the case is nolle prosequi or dismissed, the employee shall be immediately reinstated to employment retroactive to the date of suspension without loss of wages or other employee benefits.
C. Conformance to Policies, Procedures and Directives
Employees shall comply with all of the policies and operating procedures of the agency/department in which they work. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, all agency/departmental policies and procedures. Employees shall respond forthrightly and promptly to the work-related directives of their supervisors.
D. Conduct, Attitude and Demeanor
Employees are expected to conduct themselves in their official relations with the public and with their fellow employees in a manner which will enhance public respect for, and confidence in, the employee and in the Commonwealth as a whole. They must not only perform their duties in a wholly impartial manner, but must avoid any conduct which gives
109
the reasonable basis for the impression of acting otherwise.
Specifically, all employees shall avoid any action which may result in or create the reasonable basis for the impression of:
a. using public office for private gain;
b. giving preferential treatment to any citizen;
c. making work-related decisions contrary to agency/departmental policy;
d. using one's official position to harass or intimidate any person or entity outside the course of official duties.
E. Administrative Inquiries
Employees must respond promptly and fully to all administrative inquiries when directed to do so.
F. State Ethics Commission Financial Disclosure Requirements
Employees who are required to file a "Statement of Financial Disclosure" with the State Ethics Commission, under the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 268B, shall do so in a timely manner as prescribed by the State Ethics Commission. The State Ethics Commission will notify each employee who is required to file such a statement.
5. CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The Necessity For The Fair And Impartial Administration Of State Government And The Enforcement Of Its Laws Makes The Avoidance Of Any Conflict Of Interest Of Primary Importance. A Conflict Of Interest Is A Situation In Which An Employee's Private Interest, Usually Financial, Conflicts Or Raises A Reasonable Question Of Conflict With His/Her Official Duties And Responsibilities.
Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Provides Criminal And Civil Penalties For Conflict Of Interest Violations. The Following Three General Categories Of Prohibitions Are To Be Used As Guidelines For Your Information. (Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Offers Specific Details).
1. No employee may request or receive, in any manner whatsoever, compensation or anything else of value, except from the Commonwealth: (a) for performance of his/her duties; or (b) for influencing or appearing to influence such performance.
2. No employee may participate in any official action relating to any entity in which the employee or a member of his/her immediate family has a financial interest.
110
3. No employee may participate in any official action relating to any individual with whom or entity in which the employee has a substantial personal interest.
Employees have an obligation to avoid scrupulously the potential conflicts of interest which exist in their employment. They have a duty to disclose and report promptly the existence or possible existence of a conflict of interest to their agency head or his/her designee. They should request from their supervisor the transfer from their caseload of any case which involves their immediate family, close friend or any person with whom or entity in which they have some personal or financial involvement.
In addition, they have a right under law to have any question relating to a possible conflict of interest confidentially reviewed and decided by the State Ethics Commission. Information regarding the filing of a conflict of interest request with the State Ethics Commission is available from the agency head or his/her designee or from the Ethics Commission directly.
In addition to the sanctions referred to above, M.G.L. Ch. 268A, Section 23 also prescribes and describes certain " Standards of Conduct". Violations of these standards are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. All employees are required to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of these standards, which provide as follows:
"No current officer or employee of a state, county, or municipal agency shall:
(1) accept other employment which will impair his independence of judgement in the exercise of his official duties;
(2) use or attempt to use his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others;
(3) by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly influence or unduly enjoy his favor in the performance of his official duties, or that he is unduly affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person."
"No current or former officer or employee of a state, county or municipal agency shall:
(1) accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information which he has gained by reason of his official position or authority;
(2) improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by Section Seven of Chapter Four of the General Laws, and were acquired by him in the course of his official duties nor use such information to further his personal interests." (See M.G.L. Ch. 268A, S. 23).
Ill
These rules with respect to conflicts of interest are in addition to, and supplement, state policies and agency/departmental rules, regulations and operating procedures that may otherwise apply to the official actions of employees.
(In the event that the appointing authority, or his/her designee, approves a particular activity and the Ethics Commission subsequently determines that such activity is a conflict of interest, the appointing authority will not discipline the employee for such activity. However, only the Ethics Commission, and formerly the Attorney General, have the authority to issue an opinion interpreting M.G.L. Chapter 268A, which is binding.)
6. GIFTS AND GRATUITIES FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES
A. General Limitations
Employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who or entity which, the employee knows or has reason to know:
(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with his/her agency/department;
(2) Conducts business or other activities which are regulated or monitored by the agency/department, except as permitted by this section or by agency/departmental directives; or
(3) Has interests that may be or give the reasonable impression of being substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee' s official duties.
B. Exceptions
The restrictions set forth in paragraph A of this section do not apply to:
(1) Obvious family or personal relations when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships, rather than the business or the persons concerned, are the motivating factors behind any gift or gratuity.
(2) The acceptance of food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a breakfast, luncheon, dinner or other meetings attended for educational, informational or other similar purposes. However, agency/departmental employees are specifically prohibited from accepting free food or other gratuity except non-alcoholic beverages (coffee, tea, etc.), while on official business, from persons with whom they have contact in the performance of their official duties.
112
(3) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans, automobile loans, personal loans, etc., provided that the employee does not deal with that institution in the course of his/her official duties. However, if dealing with such banks or financial institutions is unavoidable, the employee must disclose dealings to the appropriate authority in writing prior to engaging in such dealings.
(4) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars, and other items of nominal value.
(5) The acceptance of an award or gift of nominal value for a speech, participation in a conference, or some public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, if such organization falls within paragraph A above.
(6) Acceptance of reimbursement, in cash or in kind, for travel, subsistence and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, provided such attendance and reimbursement is approved by the appointing authority or his/her designee. Such reimbursement can be made directly to the employee. An employee on official business may not be reimbursed, and payment may not be made on his/her behalf, for excessive (e.g., reimbursement which exceeds actual cost) personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, travel or other benefits. At no time shall an employee accept reimbursement from both the Commonwealth and another source for the same expenses.
7. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
A. Introduction: Principles
The Commonwealth seeks to give employees the maximum freedom possible to engage in outside employment or business activities consistent with the Commonwealth' s responsibilities. However, the extremely sensitive mission of the Commonwealth and its employees necessitates certain restrictions. Employees may engage in outside employment or business activity provided such activity is not prohibited by this Code or by any statute, regulation or departmental order.
An activity that is permissible for the occupant of one position may very well not be permissible for the occupant of another position. Therefore, in considering each case on its individual merits, the employee must satisfy the following principles:
113
(1) The outside activity would not place the employee in a situation where there is a conflict, or in a situation which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict, between his or her private interests and his or her official duties and responsibilities (see section 5, above, "Conflict of Interest", for additional guidance).
(2) The outside activity would not result in use, dissemination or disclosure to others of confidential information obtained in connection with the employee's departmental duties or position.
(3) The nature of the employment or business activity or the hours to be devoted to such activity would not impair the employee's availability, capacity or efficiency for the performance of his/her official duties as an employee of the Commonwealth.
(4) Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through their employment. In particular, they shall not use confidential information obtained in the course of their employment with the Commonwealth to obtain benefits, financial or otherwise, for themselves, their families or others.
B. Activities Which Do Not Require Prior Notice
(1) Introduction
Employees are generally not required to submit written notice before engaging in outside activities which are not considered to be employment or business related. Although it is not feasible to cover every specific activity of this nature, the general categories discussed below are furnished as basic guidelines.
(2) General Examples
(a) Membership and uncompensated services (including holding of office) in civic, scout, religious, educational, fraternal, social, community, veterans, or charitable organizations.
(b) Services as a notary public or justice of the peace.
(c) Rental of employee-owned property, real or personal, to the extent such property is not rented to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any agency or subdivision thereof, or the lessee is not a subject of the employee' s official duties.
114
(d) Minor services and odd jobs for friends, relatives, or neighbors. These include a wide variety of activities, including: repair or maintenance work such as painting, yard work, carpentry, or services such as babysitting and carpools involving payment for transportation.
(e) Temporary (thirty days or less) assistance in a family enterprise, in the event of an emergency, such as the death or serious illness/accident to a member of the family engaged in that business.
(f) However, no employee shall without appropriate disclaimer stating that the employee does not speak for the agency/ department, take an active part or become an advocate on behalf of a professional society in any conflict between such society and the agency/department.
C. Specific Prohibitions and Restrictions on Employment
(1) Outside Legal or Accounting Practice or Employment
(a) General Prohibitions
No outside legal or accounting practice is permitted which is in violation of M.G.L. Ch. 268A. Specifically, employees are prohibited from receiving compensation from or acting as agent or attorney for anyone other than the Commonwealth in relation to any particular matter in which the Commonwealth or a state agency is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.
To the extent that outside legal or accounting practice is permitted, it must not interfere with the effective performance of an employee' s official duties.
8. DUTY TO REPORT VIOIATIONS OF LAW AND CODE OF CONDUCT
A. Generally
Every employee is expected to maintain and uphold the integrity of the Department. In satisfying this requirement, it shall be the duty of every employee to report promptly and accurately violations of law that affect the administration of the Department or the laws of the Commonwealth to his/her agency/department head or designee. To the fullest extent possible, any such reports will be treated confidentially.
115
B. Attempts to Bribe
Bribery and attempted bribery are claims which strike at the core of state government. Employees should be constantly alert to solicitations to accept money, consideration, or anything of value in return for acts or omissions involving their official functions. Such solicitations may be indirect and subtle. Any attempt to bribe a departmental employee shall be reported immediately to the proper agency authority.
9. OTHER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
A.
False Statement
--
C. Public Records
All requests for public records should be directed to the appointing authority or his/her designee, who shall determine whether the requested documents are public records in accordance with M.G.L. c. 4, Sec. 7, C1. 26.
D. Drugs and Alcohol
While on duty no employee shall consume or use alcohol, intoxicants, narcotics, or controlled substances in any form. Similarly, no employee shall report for work under the influence of intoxicants, narcotics or controlled substances in any form. The only exception to this rule is the use of medication when prescribed for the treatment of the employee by a registered physician or dentist.
E. Departmental Identification Cards, Badges, Etc.
Agency/Departmental identification cards, badges and other identification or access cards or documents are for use only in establishing identity, authority or access in connection with official duties.
116
Agency/departmental identification cards or badges may be used for personal identification purposes when cashing checks or as proof of employment, such as when applying for a loan, for credit or when renting an apartment.
Employees are responsible for the safeguarding and proper use of agency/departmental identification cards, badges and access cards, for promptly reporting their loss and for surrendering them on termination of employment or demand by proper agency/departmental authorities.
Cards, badges or documents, or an employee' s official position or status, are not to be used to exert influence or obtain, either directly or indirectly, personal privileges, favors or rewards for themselves or others. Photo identification badges must be worn while at work in any agency which requires them to be worn.
F. Political Activities

No employee shall solicit or accept funds or anything of value for any party, political committee, agency, person or organization for political purposes.
Employees are not prohibited from contributing to the campaign committee or organization for nomination or election of any individual running for public office or to any committee, agency, or organization for political purposes.
Employees are prohibited from campaigning for political office for themselves or others during normal working hours. Employees are prohibited from being a candidate for federal, state or full-time municipal office while on active duty. Such employees must obtain a leave of absence to run for such offices.
Employees are prohibited from wearing a political or campaign button while on official agency/departmental business.
Employees shall abide by the provisions of the following paragraph from M.G.L. Ch. 268A, Section 11 which provides:
" This section shall not prohibit a state or county employee from holding an elective or appointive office in a city, town or district nor in any way prohibit such an employee from performing the duties of or receiving the compensation provided for such office. No such elected or appointed official may vote or act on any matter which is within the purview of the agency by which he/she is
117
employed or over which such employee has official responsibility." G. Testimonial Dinners Employees are prohibited from selling or accepting payment for tickets, admissions or contributions, for a testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a purpose similar to a testimonial dinner or function held on behalf of any employee of his/her agency/department. No employee shall participate in or accept contributions for or from any testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a similar purpose, held on his/her behalf while he/she is an employee if such dinner, function or affair is sponsored by a person or organization which is regulated by or has official business with the employee' s department or agency.
