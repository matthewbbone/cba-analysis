The unit member shall also file a leave request for leave for disability and a doctor's report stating he/she is unable to carry out the duties of his/her assignment due to this injury. This leave is approved by the associate superintendent of the Office of Personnel Services and is contingent upon the final approval by the MCPS-approved insurance carrier. If the leave is not approved by the MCPS-approved insurance carrier, the employee will be required to repay MCPS all monies received. This payment can be in the form of annual leave, sick leave, or lump sum payment.

A. The regularly scheduled work week shall not exceed five (5) days. The regularly scheduled workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours in addition to a duty-free lunch period. Starting and dismissal times will be assigned by the principal or the appropriate director. However, no change in starting and dismissal times in excess of two (2) hours will be made without the concur rence of the Union and the affected unit member. This limitation will not apply where the entire shift of the position assignment is changed.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing employees in the bargaining unit who work less than eight (8) hours per day and forty (40) hours per week the opportunity to work an optimal number of hours per week consistent with the operating needs and efficiency of the school system.
B. Except for bus operators and bus attendants, the workday for forty-hour per week unit members shall consist of eight (8) hours of work within eight and one-half (8) consecutive hours. The workday for unit members working less than forty (40) hours shall also consist of regularly scheduled consecutive working hours exclusive of duty-free lunch periods when applicable. Starting and dismissal times for bus operators and bus attendants will be assigned by the director of transportation. Nothing shall prevent a unit member from voluntarily requesting an exception to this section.
The transportation division will undertake a review of schedules and assign ments for the purpose of reducing the length of the downtime periods.
C. Notwithstanding the above, the Board may implement modified work weeks for safety and security personnel, not to exceed forty (40) regularly scheduled hours in a six (6) day week (Saturday, 12:01 a.m. to Friday, 12:00 p.m.). Time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a modified work week shall be overtime and paid at one and one half (1Vi) the unit member's regular rate of pay.
35
D. 1. A unit member who is requested by an appropriate official to report back to work after the unit member's normal workday or to report to work on a nonscheduled workday shall be credited with a minimum of three (3) hours of work. However, time worked immediately before or immediately after the unit member's regularly scheduled hours is not considered call back work and only the actual work time is reported.
2. When an unit member is directed in writing by a supervisor to remain at home and be ready to report for work when called, that unit member shall receive three (3) additional hours straight time pay for each day on such standby basis.
E. 1. In regard to system-wide delayed opening, only the school-based unit members in the following classifications will begin work twenty (20) minutes before the scheduled student starting time on said day without loss of pay:

F. If the entire school system, including the central office is closed at the order of the superintendent, those employees who are required to work on an emergency basis will be paid at their applicable straight time rate for the hours they work while the system is closed. This payment will be over and above the payment they would have received had they not been required to work. Where schools are closed after food service employees report to work, they will be paid at the applicable straight time rate for the hours worked, in addition to emergency leave as provided in Article 12, Section O.
G. School-based unit members and maintenance employees who are required to report to work at the beginning of their shift or remain at work until the end of their shift on days of delayed opening and early closing of schools shall receive one (1) hour pay in addition to their regular pay. It is understood this
36
additional payment to maintenance employees will apply only when the required work to be performed is related to the reasons for the delayed opening or early closing.
H. Ten-month food service employees, educational assistants, media assistants, and office employees will be notified by the closing of the school year of their next year's starting date and assignment, subject to the right of MCPS to make changes in such assignments whenever circumstances require, especially in the case of educational assistants.
I. The duties or work required of a unit member will not be increased unreason ably above those normally required because of staff shortages or schedule reductions.

C. Definition--Reduction in force shall mean an action resulting in a unit member being terminated from Montgomery County Public Schools for reasons other than disciplinary.
37
D. Procedure for Reduction--When a reduction in staff within a given classi fication occurs, the determination of those who are to be released will be in the following order
1. Probationary employees to be laid off first.
2. If further reductions are needed, those unit members with less than four (4) years' service whose two (2) most recent performance evaluations have been unacceptable and/or below average will be laid off next.
3. If still further reductions are required, seniority (as defined below) will govern, with the least senior unit member to be laid off first.
The foregoing procedure will be applied on a system-wide basis and seniority is defined as length of continuous service with the Montgomery County Public Schools.
E. Recall 1. Unit members whose services have been terminated because of a reduc tion in staff shall for a period of two (2) years receive priority consider ation for reemployment if they so desire and when Montgomery County Public Schools decides to fill vacancies. The recall will be in the inverse order of force reduction. If a unit member is notified of recall to a reasonably approximate position for which the unit member qualifies and refuses the assignment, the unit member will lose the right to further recall.
2. In the event that a unit member does not desire at the time of termination to be placed on the list for priority consideration he/she shall receive full payment for all earned unused sick leave and will lose the right to recall. For those terminated unit members having two (2) full years of service but less than six (6) years of service, they will receive, in addition, one-half month's salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public Schools' service. For those terminated unit members having six (6) or more years of service, they will receive, in addition, one month's salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public School's service up to a limit of twelve (12) months' salary.
F. Any unit member who is terminated due to a reduction in force may be placed on leave without pay for the six (6) months immediately following the last duty day and may choose to continue membership in the MCPS health benefit plan in which th j unit member is enrolled by paying the full cost of membership in such plan during those six months. If the member is not recalled, or refuses an assignment before the end of the initial six-month period, the leave without pay and the membership in the MCPS health benefit plan is automatically termi nated.
38
G. A nonbargaining unit employee may not exercise seniority rights to bump into or be placed in a MCCSSE bargaining unit classification during a time of a RIF affecting that classification or while there are unit members on active recall status who are eligible for work in such classification.
H. It is the goal of the parties to avoid layoff of unit members to the extent possible. The superintendent will attempt to provide a period of retraining for nonprobationary unit members so that they can be placed in positions for which they would not otherwise qualify without such training.
I. Any action taken under the foregoing provisions, except for the decision referred to in Section A, shall be grievable under Article 6 .
Article 16 Position Descriptions
A. Upon request, each unit member will be provided with an accurate description of his/her duties or responsibilities in the form of a class specification.
B. A copy of a unit member's class specification will be included in each employment package to be distributed during orientation.
C. Any unit member dissatisfied with an adverse reclassification which results in a pay reduction or downgrading may appeal direcdy to the superintendent whose decision shall be final. A unit member assigned to a lower grade classification as a result of a reclassification will be placed on the lower pay grade without reduction in pay. When the same rate of pay does not exist in the lower pay grade, the unit member's hourly rate of pay will be red-circled which will remain in effect for no more than three (3) years from the effective date of the reclassification action. The unit member's anniversary date for step increases will not be affected.
D. The MCCSSE shall be notified in advance when a classification action is to be taken which reduces the pay or pay grade of a unit member.
E. Upon the request of MCCSSE, and at mutually agreeable times, a member of the classification staff will meet with a representative of MCCSSE to discuss classification matters.

Where the employee elects to make the statement in person to the deciding official, a MCCSSE representative may be present.
Article 18 Dues Checkoff

If this certification is not received by the Division of Payroll, no deduction will be made.
D. The right of dues checkoff in this article shall be granted exclusively to MCCSSE.
E. MCCSSE shall indemnify and save the Board harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or any other forms of liability that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Board for the purposes of complying with any list, notice, form, card, or assignment furnished under any such provisions.

To
51
achieve the goal of developing and implementing a comprehensive program of in-service training, the Board agrees to budget the sum of $75,000 for instructional support for system-designed training programs, to hire consult ants, and to develop relevant programs.
