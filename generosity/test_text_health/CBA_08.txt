ARTICLE VI WORKWEEK AND PAYMENT OF WAGES
6.1
The work week, for pay purposes, shall commence at 8:00 A.M., on Monday and end at 8:00 A.M., the following Monday. Upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union, which mutual agreement shall be reduced to writing, the starting time on a particular job may be advanced to, but not earlier than 7:00 A.M., and the quitting time shall be eight and one-half hours after the starting time. However, no job shall start earlier than 7:00 A.M., and no Union nor Employer shall be responsible for obtaining or paying premium pay if a bricklayer reports for work earlier than 7:00 A.M.
6.2
It is hereby agreed that employees shall be paid on the job before 4:00 P.M. on Wednesday of the week following the week in which the work was performed, except where a holiday is celebrated on a Monday of the week in which payment is made, in which case payment shall be made before 4:00 P.M.Thursday of the said week. All payroll checks issued must have the contractor's name, his office or home address, and telephone number printed thereon. A detachable stub recording social security taxes and other authorized deductions shall be attached to all pay checks.
6.3 Time checks payable at the office of the Employer
shall be considered valid, provided the employee be allowed two hours for traveling time. Said traveling time shall be added to the time check by the person issuing the same. If he is not paid promptly upon his arrival at the office and is obliged to wait during working hours, he shall be allowed regular wages for such waiting time. When an employee is directed during the work day expressly to go from one job site to another, he shall be paid for all reasonable time spent in traveling from the initial site to the other site.
6.4 When an employee is discharged he shall be paid
5
in full and also when he is laid off, if he demands it, except when the lay-off is caused by bad weather or joists high. When an employee quits of his own accord, he shall receive his pay on the next regular pay day.

6.6 Should an employee fail to receive his wages on
pay day he shall immediately report same to the Union with all facts concerning the case. The Union is permitted to stop any job of an Employer for any non-payment by that Employer of wages or fringes and may publicize such stoppage or attempted stoppage of work (anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding), and no employee shall be requested or required to work on any job for the Employer until all wages and fringes have been paid in full. Thereafter, the employees shall be permitted to return to their jobs without discrimination or reprisal.
6.7 The normal work week shall consist of forty hours
to be paid at the minimum wage rate. Time and one-half shall be paid for work performed in excess of forty hours in one week or in excess of eight hours in one day or on Saturday, except as provided in this section. No disciplinary action will be taken against any bricklayer who refuses to work more than eight hours in one day or forty hours in one week or on a Saturday. Saturday may be used as a make-up day at the straight time rate of pay when work is lost during the regular work week due to inclement weather. First preference for Saturday make-up work will be given to the crews on the job. A contractor who is proven to have worked a Saturday make-up day for any reason other than inclement weather shall not be eligible to work Saturday make-up for the remaining term of the contract. If a Saturday is used as a holiday make-up day, it shall be paid at double-time. Hours worked more than eight on any Saturday shall be paid at the double-time rate of pay.

7
be performed on Labor Day except in cases of dire emergency and with the consent of the President of the Union.
. When a day other than the holiday is missed during a holiday week because of inclement weather, then Saturday may be scheduled and worked as a make-up day at straight time rates.

ARTICLE VII WAGES AND FRINGE BENEFIT
FUND CONTRIBUTIONS
7.1 The Local Unions comprising the District Council
participate in and are affiliated with various fringe benefit funds. The parties to this Agreement may agree to provide for different fringe benefit fund contributions for work performed within the geographical jurisdiction of one Local Union and another. As set forth in this Article, the recipient and division of fringe benefit fund contributions to be paid for work performed under this Agreement will depend on the Local Union affiliation of the employee performing the work or on the location where the work was performed.
8
7.2 If an employee is a member of a Local Union which
is a member of the District Council, that Local Union shall be the employee's "Home Local." If an employee has a Home Local, fringe benefit contributions on behalf of that employee shall be paid to the Depository Account for Employer Contributions, as provided in Article XXXIII, Section 33.27, for distribution to the fringe benefit funds with which the employee's Home Local is affiliated, or, if the employee has no Home Local, for distribution to the funds with which the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed is affiliated; except that with respect to contributions to the local apprenticeship and training funds, such contributions shall be distributed through the Depository Account to the local apprenticeship and training fund with which the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed is affiliated, regardless of whether the employee on whose behalf the contribution is made has a Home Local.
7.3 The "Standard Payment" shall be the wages and
fringe benefit fund contributions set forth in section 7.4. The parties to this Agreement may, through side letters or other appropriate written instruments, mutually agree from time to time that the fringe benefit contributions as to one or more Local Unions will be different than the Standard Payment, with such side letters or other written instruments to be negotiated and executed only by duly appointed representatives of the District Council and the Northern Illinois Mason Employers Council. If the parties to this Agreement provide for fringe benefit contributions different than the Standard Payment, the contributions paid for work by a particular employee will be based on the formula for the employee's Home Local if he has one. If the employee has no Home Local, contributions will be based on the formula for the Local Union within whose geographical jurisdiction the work was performed, except that the contributions for an employee without a Home Local whose employment is covered by a reciprocity agreement will be based on the Standard Payment.

ARTICLE VIII JOINT TRUSTEESHIP OF LOCAL INDUSTRY PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT FUNDS
8.1 The Union desires that the Illinois Masonry Institute
and the Local Industry Promotion and Advancement Funds (with the exception of the Masonry Industry Advancement Fund ["Ml AP]) be jointly trusteed, with an equal number of Trustees representing Employers and employees, and they contend that such joint trusteeship is lawful under Section 302(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act.

Therefore, the parties agree that jointly administered successor trusts to those industry promotion and advancement funds shall be created, subject to the following limitations, and contributions required to be paid under this contract to those industry promotion and advancement funds shall be payable to the successor funds:
(a) The joint trusteeship of industry promotion or advancement funds shall be determined to be lawful by a final judgment issued by any federal court.
(b) The joint Boards of Trustees shall consist of five employer and five employee representatives, each of whom shall have an equal vote.
(c) In the event that less than five Trustees on a side shall be in attendance at a meeting, the votes of each Trustee present on that side shall be increased proportionately, so that all of the Trustees on a side who are present at a meeting shall be entitled to collectively cast a total of five votes.
(d) Seven affirmative votes shall be required to adopt a resolution of the Board ofTrustees. The successor trust funds shall not be used for the
19
purpose of providing apprenticeship training.

Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary in this Agreement or in such Agreements and Declarations of Trust, contributions shall be due and payable as provided in this Article.

Such stoppage or attempted stoppage of work and the publicizing of such to collect contributions to the Health and Welfare Funds, Pension Funds, Apprenticeship Programs, Promotion Trust Funds, Annuity Funds, District Council Training Center Fund, or International Pension Fund
55
shall not be considered a violation of this Agreement on the part of the Union and it shall not be a subject of arbitration.
E. If employees are withdrawn from any job in order to collect contributions to the Health and Welfare Funds, the Pension Funds, Apprenticeship Programs, Promotion Trust Funds, Annuity Funds, District Council Training Center Fund, or International Pension Fund, the employees who are affected by such stoppage of work shall be paid for lost time up to 16 hours provided that two (2) days' notice of the intention to remove employees from a job is given to the Employer by the Union by registered or certified mail.
F. The Employer shall furnish to the Trustees. upon request, such information and reports as they may require in the performance of their duties. The Trustees, or any authorized agent of the Trustees, shall have the right at all reasonable times during business hours to enter upon the premises of the Employer and to examine and copy such books, records, papers, and reports of the Employer as may be necessary to permit the Trustee to determine whether the Employer is fully complying with the provisions regarding Employer contributions. Any Employer found delinquent through regular or special audit ordered by the Trustees shall be charged the full cost of such audit.
G. The Trustees are hereby given the power and the authority to institute whatever legal proceedings may be necessary to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Article. Legal fees incurred by the Trustees in enforcing compliance with this Article shall be charged to the delinquent Employer.
H. The contributions, as aforesaid, shall accrue with respect to all hours worked by any journeyman or apprentice, or supervisor to the extent this Agreement so provides, represented by the Union or for any person doing any work within the jurisdiction of the Union and said contributions shall accrue with respect to all hours worked by employees, and by supervisors to the extent this Agreement so provides, covered by the terms of this Joint Agreement for Employers
56
within or without the geographical jurisdiction of the Union's jurisdiction, except that when work is performed outside the Union's jurisdiction wherein another Welfare Plan or Pension Plan is effective and the Employer makes contributions to that fund, then the said Employer shall not be required to make a double contribution; provided, however, that the primary duty to make payments for work performed within the jurisdiction of the Union shall be for all Employers to pay to the Health and Welfare Funds, the Pension Funds, the Apprenticeship Programs, the Promotion Trust Funds, the Annuity Funds, the District Council Training Center Fund, and the International Pension Fund, the contributions provided for in this Agreement,
33.31 Reports to Union and Trustees:
A. In order to assist in the collection of the contributions required pursuant to this Agreement, all Employers shall furnish the following reports to theTrustees of the Health and Welfare Funds, Pension Funds, Apprenticeship Programs, Promotion Trust Funds, Annuity Funds, District Council Training Center Fund, International Pension Fund, or to the Union as indicated:
(1) All Employers shall annually furnish to theTrustees of the Health and Welfare Funds, Pension Funds, Apprenticeship Programs, Promotion Trust Funds, Annuity Funds, District Council Training Center Fund, and International Pension Fund on dates determined by the respective Trustees, a statement showing whether (1) the Employer is a corporation and the names of all officers and directors of said Employer; (2) if not a corporation, a certificate stating who are the constituent persons composing the Employer and their respective interest in the same.
(2) Each Employer shall furnish to the Bricklayers Northern Trust Fringe Benefit Account, on a monthly basis, a remittance report listing the names of all Bricklayers employed by the Em-
57
ployer during the month which the remittance report is made. For months in which no Bricklayers were employed, the remittance report of the Employer for that month shall so state, The reports required to be furnished pursuant to this section shall be received by the Bank on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month.
(3) Each Employer shall furnish to the Union on a weekly basis a report listing the name and address of each job site where work covered by this Agreement was performed during the week for which the report is made and the name of the foreman employed on each job.
B. If any Employer fails to file the required reports provided for above and such failure continues for seventy-two (72) hours after the Employer has received written notice thereof, the Union may stop any job of that Employer and/or withdraw the employees from such Employer's employment and may publicize such stoppage or attempted stoppage of work, until all required reports have been provided, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.
33.32 Payment Bond:
A. Any Employer who is delinquent for sixty (60) days or more in making payments of wages, fringe benefit fund contributions, or any Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of employees pursuant to a check-off authorization shall, at the request of the Union, furnish a satisfactory surety company's bond to guarantee payment of wages and contributions to said funds and Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of an employee pursuant to a check-off authorization as required by this Agreement. The bond shall be in the amount of $5,000.00 if the Employer has three (3) employees or fewer working under this Agreement; in the amount of $15,000.00 if the Employer has four (4) to ten (10) such employees; in the amount of $30,000.00 if the Employer has eleven (11) to twenty (20) such employees; in
58
the amount of $45,000.00 if the Employer has twenty-one (21) , to thirty (30) such employees. The bond shall increase
$15,000.00 for each additional ten (10) employees.
The determination of the number of employees working under the Agreement for purposes of setting the amount of the bond will be based on the largest number of such employees within the twelve month period preceding the Union's request that a bond be posted but the Union may, at its sole discretion, request or agree to accept a bond in a lesser amount i if the Union determines that a bond in a lesser amount is reasonably likely to provide the security sought and that requiring 1 a bond in a greater amount would present a significant burden to the Employer. No action by the Union in requesting or agreeing to accept a bond in a lesser amount than otherwise provided from one Employer but not from another Employer will be deemed to violate the Most Favored Nations Clause of the , Agreement.
If an Employer becomes delinquent for sixty (60) days with respect to any of the specified obligations, it is required to post a bond upon request by the Union even if it cures or has cured the delinquency.
The Union may, at its sole discretion, accept a cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other security instrument which it deems proper, and if such an alternate security instrument is provided and accepted, all references in this Article and elsewhere in this Agreement to a "bond" shall be deemed to apply to such alternate security instrument.
Any Employer which is required to post a bond pursuant to this section shall maintain the bond until it has satisfied all obligations under the Agreement and has incurred no delinquencies for two years.
B. In the event that a bond is posted, delinquencies occur, recovery is sought against the bond, and the total unpaid wages and benefit fund contributions and Union dues exceed the amount of the bond, payment shall be apportioned among all wages and benefit contributions and Union dues on
59
a pro rata basis, whereby each wage claim and each fringe benefit obligation and each payment of Union dues will be paid at the same percentage.
C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Union is not required to utilize the grievance or arbitration procedure if an Employer which may be required to post a payment bond fails to do so within ten days of the time the Union submits a written request to the Employer to do so. The Union may, upon expiration of such ten days, seek immediate relief in any court of proper jurisdiction. If the Union utilizes this provision of the Agreement to obtain an order from a court requiring an Employer to furnish a payment bond, the Union shall be entitled to recover from that Employer all reasonable legal fees and cost incurred, and shall be entitled to recover such fees and costs as a part of. the legal action without resort to the grievance or arbitration procedure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, if an Employer which is required to post a payment bond fails to do so within ten days of the time the Union submits a written request to the Employer to do so, the Union may, at its sole discretion, withdraw the employees of the Employer or take other economic action, and may publicize its dispute with the Employer regarding the obligation to post a bond. The Union's rights to engage in such actions and to take other steps as described in this Section to obtain a bond are cumulative. No decision or action by the Union to use one or more methods of seeking to obtain a bond from one Employer but not from another Employer will be deemed to violate the Most Favored Nations Clause of the Agreement.
D. If any party to this Agreement believes there is a reasonable possibility that wages, contributions required by this Article, or Union dues which have been deducted from the wages of an employee pursuant to a check-off authorization will go unpaid and will be lost if no action is taken to obtain a payment bond prior to an Employer being delinquent for sixty (60) days or more, that party may, upon 72 hours written notice to such Employer, present the question to the Joint Arbi-
60
tration Board ("JAB") as discussed in Article XII of this Agreei ment. The JAB will be required to convene and hear evidence presented by the party raising the issue, along with any evi1 dence presented by or on behalf of the Employer in question.
If the JAB determines there is a reasonable possibility that the payment of wages, contributions required by this Article, or the Union dues will not be made and will be lost in the absence of such action, it shall require the employer to obtain a
i payment bond as discussed in Paragraph A of this Section, notwithstanding the fact that no delinquency exists or that a i delinquency has not existed for sixty (60) days. In determining whether a payment bond should be required under these circumstances, the JAB cannot act in an arbitrary manner. Without limiting the right of the JAB to require an Employer to ob-
' tain a payment bond under the provisions set forth in this parai graph for other reasons, one reason the JAB may require an Employer to obtain such a bond is that the Employer, or an i owner or principal of the Employer, is or was associated with or affiliated with an Employer which had delinquencies on previous occasions. If the JAB rules an Employer should obtain a payment bond pursuant to the terms of this paragraph, the Employer must do so within ten days of receipt of written notice of such decision by the JAB and if the Employer fails to do so, the Union may then utilize the procedures set forth in Paragraph C of this section.
E. Any employer who signs or becomes bound to this collective bargaining agreement with the Union after May 31, 2000 ("New Employer") will be required within 14 days of signing or becoming bound to the Agreement to post a bond in an amount determined by the number of its employees in accord with the formula set forth in Section 33.32 A. The provisions of Section 33.32 A., B., and C. shall apply to such bonds posted by a New Employer except that (1) in addition to the remedies provided in Section 33.32 C. available to the Union, the Union may also cancel the collective bargaining agreement with the New Employer for failing to comply with the obligation to post a bond, which cancellation will be effective upon the Union giving the New Employer written notice it is exercising this right, and (2) any New Employer who posts such a bond as required and has no delinquencies for two
61
years from the date of signing or becoming bound to the Agreement shall be permitted to cancel the bond and thereafter shall be subject to a bond obligation only in accord with Sections 33.32 A. and D.
33.33 Apprentices:
A. In order to maintain a sufficient number of skilled mechanics, the necessity for employment of apprentices is hereby recognized, and the employment and proper training for as many apprentices as is reasonable and practicable shall be encouraged by all parties to this Agreement. To this end the Employers shall be required on the basis of a fair quota system established by the Trustees of the applicable Apprenticeship Program to employ as many apprentices as the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Program shall determine. Apprentices shall be under the complete control and jurisdiction of the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Program.
8. Apprentice Training: The Apprenticeship Program shall train apprentices adequately in safety and first aid.
C. Wages of Apprentices: The wages of apprentices shall be as follows:
50% of Journeyman's wage scale for 1 st six months 60% of Journeyman's wage scale for 2nd six months 70% of Journeyman's wage scale for 3rd six months 80% of Journeyman's wage scale for 4th six months 90% of Journeyman's wage scale for 5th six months 95% of Journeyman's wage scale for 6th six months
D. Each Employer shall employ one (1) apprentice for each five (5) journeymen bricklayers when said apprentices are available, except that on all residential work three stories or less with a maximum of twenty-five dwelling units per structure, the Employer may, at his sole option, employ up to two apprentices for each journeyman bricklayer.
E. In order to expose apprentices to all aspects of the trade, apprentices shall not operate a saw for more than
62
eight (8) hours in any one work week except in unusual circumstances. No apprentice shall be entitled to any back pay or other monetary remedy for any violation of this provision, it being understood that this provision shall be enforced solely by a cease and desist remedy for any such violation.
F. An apprentice category designated "Novice Trainee" will exist, with such category ceasing to exist effective May 3 1 , 2004, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Employers may employ novice trainees to perform work covered by Article X. Each novice trainee must pay a $25.00 registration fee to the applicable Local Union and must produce the receipt for such payment while working as a novice trainee, and no Employer shall permit an individual to work as a novice trainee unless and until that individual presents the registration fee receipt to the Employer. Employment of each novice trainee is limited to a 200 hour probationary period, after which period the Employer must decide whether the novice trainee will be retained, either as an advanced apprentice through the Local 21 apprenticeship program or as an apprentice through the apprenticeship program of Local 14, 20, 27, 56, or 74, or be terminated. No individual may work as a novice trainee for more than 200 hours for any one Employer or a cumulative total of more than 200 hours for more than one Employer; and it shall be the responsibility of each Employer hiring an individual as a novice trainee to assure compliance with this requirement. The Employer must notify the District Council in writing when a novice trainee is either terminated or retained, and must do so within 48 hours of informing the novice trainee. Failure by the Employer to provide such written notice or otherwise abide by the requirements of this Section 33.33 may be grounds for the Joint Arbitration Board to impose an appropriate remedy, including barring the Employer from future employment of novice trainees. If the novice trainee is to be retained, it will be his or her responsibility to apply to the apprenticeship program affiliated with the appropriate Local Union, and such application will be treated as would any application for entry into that apprenticeship program. The decision of the Employer to terminate a novice trainee during or at the end of the probationary period will be at the Employer's sole discretion and will not be subject to challenge through
63
the procedures of Article XII.
Novice trainees will be paid 45% of the minimum wage rate set for journeymen. No benefit fund contributions or other payments except wages will be paid on behalf of a novice trainee unless he or she is retained after the 200 hour probationary period, at which point the Employer must pay Health and Welfare and Annuity contributions retroactively for the probationary period; and thereafter all contributions and payments will be made on a prospective basis. The Employer recognizes that novice trainees will not have received the safety and first aid training provided by the Apprenticeship Program, and must take proper steps to compensate for that lack of training.
An Employer may employ one novice trainee for the first ten or fewer journeymen in its employ. After the Employer uses an initial novice trainee, the Employer must abide by the ten to one ratio and at least one apprentice must be included among the ten journeymen when available. The Local Union in whose area the work is being performed must approve application of the ratio for employment of more than one novice trainee. Employers may only employ novice trainees if they are current on all fringe benefit fund contributions, and no Employer may employ a novice trainee if there is a pending Joint Arbitration Board decision with which it has not complied.
33.34 Refractory Provisions:
All refractory provisions shall be superseded by the International Union Agreement when negotiated.
33.35 Composite Crews:
For in-plant and precast installation work involving composite crews of Bricklayers and Boilermakers or Ironworkers, Bricklayer employees will be entitled to the most favorable show-up and premium pay provisions for such work.
64
ARTICLE XXXIV SAVINGS CLAUSE 34.1 Should any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement be found in violation of any federal or state law, based on final court decisions or rulings of authorized governmental agencies, then such terms and conditions shall become void and ineffective immediately on written notice to this effect from one party to the other, but all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 34.2 In the event there is a disagreement on the legal interpretation of said court decisions or rulings, the subject matter shall be promptly referred to the Joint Arbitration Board for final determination through legal counsel.
