Section 1: All employees shall be required to perform any and all temporarily assigned duties, regardless of their usual or customary duties or job assignment. Temporary transfers shall be made on an equitable basis. A temporary transfer shall not exceed thirty (30) working days, except:

A. To fill a vacancy caused by an employee being on sick or other approved leave of absence;

B. To provide vacation relief scheduling;

C. To fill an opening temporarily pending permanent filling of such opening; or

D. To meet an emergency situation.

Section 2: When an employee is temporarily transferred to another job classification for at least two (2) hours:

A. If the pay grade of such other classification is lower than his regular pay grade, he shall receive his regular pay grade rate.

B. If the pay grade for such other classification is higher than his regular pay grade, he shall be paid the pay grade rate of such other classification at the same step he holds in his regular pay grade except that an employee who is temporarily transferred out of his classification series more than two (2) pay grades higher shall receive either the base rate of that classification or a step in that classification closest to a two (2) step increment, whichever is higher.

Section 3: With the exception of existing seven (7) day a week operations, the work shall be assigned on a five (5) consecutive day per week basis with two (2) consecutive days off. The present method of scheduling employees at Westmoreland Manor shall be maintained.

Section 4: There will be no split shifts unless the County, the Union and the employee mutually agree.

Section 5: The County agrees to maintain its present practices regarding rest breaks during normal work shifts.

Section 6: The practice of summer scheduling in the parks will continue with employees working twelve (12) hours on Saturdays and Sundays and taking a day off during the week. Overtime will continue to be waived for the hours worked on these Saturdays and Sundays.

The waiver of overtime will only apply to the employees normally scheduled under the summer schedule and not employees scheduled for special events in the parks. The summer schedule will begin with the first weekend in May and conclude with the last weekend in September.

Section 7: The County will adopt the proposed twelve (12) hour schedule for TCO’s on a trial basis for at least three (3) months. At the end of that time period, or any time thereafter, the County reserves the right to return to a schedule it deems necessary. The County will meet and discuss the effect of the schedule change and it’s effective date at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the change in schedule. TCO’s will continue to earn sick time and vacation time at the current accrual rates. Accrued hours will be divided by the length of the shift to determine available sick and vacation days. The value of a personal day will be the length of a shift.
