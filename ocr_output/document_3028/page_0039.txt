APPENDIX "D"

WESTMORELAND COUNTY

HEPATITIS B INOCULATION POLICY

Westmoreland County has decided to provide Hepatitis B inoculations to at risk employees and to follow up the three (3) shot series with a blood test to determine the result. Employees will be given the inoculations free of charge if they complete the series. Those employees who start the series and do not complete it in the recommended time frame will be charged the contracted rate of $36.66 per shot received. This could amount to $73.32 for employees who receive the first two (2) shots and do not follow up with their third (3rd) inoculation.

All shots are scheduled in advance at a location and time that is announced (usually at Westmoreland Manor). If an employee is unable to attend the scheduled inoculation, they must notify their supervisor immediately who will then contact the Human Resources Department. These employees will be instructed to report to Med. Care in Youngwood for their inoculation. Those employees receiving shots at Med Care must do so within two (2) days of the missed scheduled day. Employees receiving their shot at Med Care for whatever reason, will be required to pay for the cost of the office visit and will not be reimbursed for this. Westmoreland County will provide Med Care with the needed serum. Employees with valid and documented medical reasons for not continuing with the series of shots will be exempt from this policy. Employees leaving the employment of Westmoreland County prior to completion of the series will have the cost of the shots received deducted from their final pay.

I ____________________________ have read the above policy and agree to its terms and conditions. By signing this I knowingly give Westmoreland County permission to deduct the above cost from my paycheck in accordance with this policy.
