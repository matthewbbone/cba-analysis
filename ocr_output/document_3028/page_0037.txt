13. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognized the desire to offer employees at Westmoreland Manor consistent and reasonable schedules including scheduling alternate weekends off, and that the work schedules for employees at Westmoreland Manor must be altered to accommodate this scheduling change. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. agree that the ultimate goal is quality care for the residents of Westmoreland Manor and recognize that staffing directly affects this goal. Therefore, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:

A. Employees at Westmoreland Manor will be scheduled for alternate weekends off. Alternate weekends off will be implemented and maintained according to the following schedule:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>% of Staff on Alternate W/E Schedule</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/02</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/03</td>
    <td>40%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/03</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/04</td>
    <td>70%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/04</td>
    <td>90%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/05</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

B. If at any point, due to increasing vacancy rates that are expected to last beyond one month, the County reserves the right to schedule employees at every third weekend off. This change in schedule will affect the least senior employees (per classification, per shift) and only the number of employees necessary to affect safe staffing numbers.
