Section 6: In the event an employee is required to work beyond their normal work day and management anticipates that a minimum of four (4) additional hours of work will be required, employees will be given a meal break of one-half (1/2) hour with pay. The meal break shall be scheduled within said four (4) additional hours; however, if management determines, at its sole discretion, that a meal break cannot be scheduled because of the operational needs of the department, the employee shall be paid seven dollars ($7.00) in lieu of said meal break. Said payment shall not be included in the regular rate of pay, nor shall it be included in the calculation of overtime or premium pay. Employees shall be reimbursed in accordance with the existing meal allowance of the County and any improvements thereto.

Section 7: When a situation occurs within the County that imposes a hazard to public safety, it is agreed that any employee shall be assigned to the abatement of that hazard, regardless of whether the work is overtime or not, without violating this Agreement.

Section 8: No employee will unreasonably refuse to work overtime on any day when the necessity for working such overtime arises. The County reserves the right to discipline, suspend or discharge any employee who violates the provisions of this article. The preceding notwithstanding, however, the fact that other qualified employees were available and did perform the necessary overtime shall be given consideration when disciplinary action is contemplated for a refusal to work overtime.

Section 9: Overtime distribution rosters will be posted in each department.

Section 10: Any employee who is required to work on an unscheduled day in his defined work week shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 ½ ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such days. These hours shall not be pyramided. This proviso shall not include voluntary schedule changes between and among employees nor the assignment of additional work days within a schedule of less than five (5) days. Accordingly, the County shall not be liable for any overtime payments arising there from. Employees receiving premium pay for working an unscheduled day will forfeit said premium pay if they call off sick and therefore did not work at least forty (40) hours in a week in which the unscheduled day is worked. If the employee presents a doctor’s excuse for the sick day upon his next scheduled work day, they will be paid for the day.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN (13)
CALL-IN PAY

Section 1: An employee who is called in to work at a time when he is not regularly scheduled to report for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at the applicable rate of pay. An employee who is called into work on his regularly scheduled day off shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at one and one-half (1 ½ ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such day or days. These hours will not be pyramided. If circumstances beyond the control of the County prohibit an employee or employees from working, the aforementioned guarantee will not apply. If a dispute arises over “beyond the control of the County”, the matter will be submitted immediately to an arbitrator. Should the arbitration award favor the position of the Union, the County will pay all associated arbitration fees.

Section 2: An employee on regular schedule reporting for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work at the applicable rate of pay.

Section 3: Employees who are scheduled for stand-by time shall be paid seventy dollars ($70.00) per week. Employees scheduled for stand-by time for periods less than one (1) week shall be paid ten dollars ($10.00) per shift that they are on stand-by.
Stand-by time shall apply only to the following departments and classifications:

Coroner’s Office – Deputy Coroner

In addition, only one (1) employee per department per work week shall be scheduled for stand-by. If the County determines that a classification or department other than those listed above are needed to be placed on stand-by, they will meet and discuss with the Union prior to implementation.
