No such employee can be reinstated without the County first receiving medical certification as to the employee's ability to return to work.

G. Acceptance of other employment while on authorized leave of absence, including sick leave, unless said employment is authorized in accordance with this Agreement.

H. Any unauthorized absence which exceeds three (3) work days shall be considered an abandonment of employment.

Section 3: When an employee whose continuous service has been broken by any of the above causes is again hired, he shall begin as a new employee of the County.

Section 4: New employees shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first forty-five (45) working days of their employment and shall not be entitled to seniority during that period. Upon completion of this period of forty-five (45) working days, the seniority of such employees, if retained as employees, shall be effective as of the date of their employment as probationary employees. During an employee's probationary period, he shall have no seniority rights and shall not be entitled to any of the other benefits, rights and entitlements of this Agreement. A probationary employee may be summarily dismissed during his probationary period at the sole discretion of the County, and said dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. The Union will not refuse reasonable requests by the County to extend an employee's probationary period. During such extension, an employee is entitled to all benefits, rights, and entitlements of the contract except that dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

However, such employee shall be required to complete the required thirty (30) working day trial period in Article Fifteen (15), Section Six (6) and/or the orientation period. Notwithstanding Article One (1), Section Three (3) (C) herein to the contrary, the orientation period applicable to any Westmoreland Manor Nursing position shall not count towards fulfilling the forty-five (45) working day probationary period. Employees changing job titles shall not be required to complete another probationary period to become eligible for benefits.

Section 5: Absence due to sickness or accident disability or other approved leave of absence shall not constitute an interruption of continuous service, except as provided in Section Two (2).

The County shall semi-annually provide the Union with an updated seniority list of employees and their classification.

Section 8: Any employee promoted to a position outside of the unit covered by this Agreement will retain the right to return to his former position, within one (1) year from date of promotion, provided a vacancy exists. Said employee shall be entitled to fill the first such vacancy, notwithstanding Article Sixteen (16) to the contrary. Such employee shall retain all seniority which he accrued prior to the time of his promotion. However, he shall not accrue any seniority for the time spent outside his bargaining unit.
