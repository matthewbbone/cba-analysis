Unresolved disputes between the County and the Union are injurious to the public and both parties, therefore, are aware that adequate means must be established for minimizing them and providing for their resolution. The County and the Union agree that this overall policy may be best accomplished by negotiating in good faith and entering into written agreements evidencing the result of such negotiations and by establishing procedures to provide for the protection of the County and its employees and to insure to the public orderly and uninterrupted services.\n\nARTICLE ONE (1)\n\nRECOGNITION\n\nSection 1: The County of Westmoreland, hereinafter referred to as the \"County\" pursuant to Section 606 of the Public Employee Relation Act Number 195 of July 23, 1970, as may be amended, and in accordance with certification by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, Case Number PERA-R-391-W, PERA-R-2041-W, hereby recognizes the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as \"Union,\" as the exclusive representative for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nSection 2: The following departments or, as used interchangeably, \"offices,\" shall constitute administrative units solely for purposes of implementing specific contractual obligations defined herein.\nA.

Temporary employees shall not be entitled to any benefits, rights and entitlements under this Agreement; however, a regular part-time employee who is temporarily replacing a regular employee shall not lose his part-time status. Any temporary employee who is awarded a permanent full-time position in the classification in which he is currently working shall receive one (1) day of credit toward satisfying his probationary period for each day of work performed during the preceding six (6) month period.\n\nD. A \"part-time employee\" shall be defined herein as an employee who is hired to fill a regular position and who is regularly scheduled to work between seventeen (17) and forty-nine (49) hours in a pay period.

Any other type of retirement, as may be defined under the County Pension Law, Act 96 of August 31, 1971, as may be amended, shall not be construed as a 'retirement' under the terms and provisions of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE TWO (2)\n\nMANAGEMENT RIGHTS\n\nExcept as expressly limited by County Code, other relevant statutes and codes, or provisions of this Agreement, and reserving unto the County all management rights which, by law, may not be bargainable, the County shall have and retain, solely and exclusively, all other managerial rights and responsibilities which shall include, but not be limited to, such areas of discretion or policy as: the functions and programs of the County, standards of services, its overall budget, utilization of technology, the organizational structure and selection and direction of personnel.\n\nFurther, the listing of specific rights in this Agreement is not intended to be nor shall it be considered restrictive or a waiver of any of the rights of management not listed and not specifically surrendered herein, whether or not such rights have been exercised by the County in the past.\n\nARTICLE THREE (3)\n\nNON DISCRIMINATION\n\nSection 1: The Union agrees to continue to admit all employees to membership and to represent all employees without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation, or the proper exercise by an employee of his rights guaranteed by the Public Employee Relations Act Number 195 of July 23, 1970, as may be amended.\n\nSection 2: The County agrees to continue its established policy against all forms of illegal discrimination with regard to race, creed, color, national origin, disability, sex, age or the proper exercise by an employee of his rights guaranteed by the Public Employee Relations Act Number 195 of July 23, 1970, as may be amended.\n\nSection 3: Unless otherwise provided herein, the masculine pronoun shall import the feminine, the singular number shall import the plural and vice versa, as applicable.\n\nARTICLE FOUR (4)\n\nSTRIKE PLEDGES\n\nSection 1: For the duration of this Agreement, or any extension thereof, the Union, its officers, representatives and members shall not authorize, instigate, cause, aid, encourage, ratify or condone, nor shall any employee take part in any strike.

Westmoreland County agrees to give the Union immediate notice of any such legal action brought against it, and agrees to cooperate fully with the Union in the defense of the case. If Westmoreland County does not fully cooperate with the Union, any obligation of the Union to provide a defense under this Section shall cease.\n\nE. The Union agrees in any action to defend, to indemnify and hold Westmoreland County harmless for any and all damages and liability, the County might be liable for as a consequence of its compliance with this Section; except that it is expressly understood that this save harmless provision will not apply to any legal action which may arise as a result of any willful act by Westmoreland County as a result of the County's failure to properly perform its obligations under this Section.\n\nF. The County agrees to deduct a fair share fee bi-weekly from all employees in the Bargaining Unit who are not members of the Union.\n\nG. Authorization from non-Union members to deduct fair share fee shall not be required. The amounts to be deducted shall be certified to the County by the Union, and the aggregate deductions of all employees shall be remitted together with an itemized statement to the Union by the last day of the succeeding month after such deductions are made.\n\nARTICLE SIX (6)\n\nCHECK-OFF\n\nSection 1: The County and Union shall deduct regular initiation fees and monthly dues from the pay of employees covered by this Agreement upon receipt from the Union of individual written authorization cards voluntarily executed by an employee for that purpose and bearing his signature, provided that:\nA. An employee shall have the right to revoke such authorization by giving written notice to the County and Union fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration day of this contract.\n\nB. The County's obligation to make deductions shall terminate automatically upon timely receipt of revocation by the employee of authorization or upon termination of employment or promotion or transfer to a job classification outside the bargaining unit. Upon written request from the Union for bi-monthly deductions, the County shall comply after a meeting and discussion on the formula.\n\nSection 2: Deductions under Section One (1) shall be made during the second pay period of each month and transmitted to the Union no later than the fifteenth (15) day following the end of the pay period in which the deduction is made and, upon receipt, the Union shall assume full responsibility for the disposition of all funds deducted.\n\nSection 3: The Union shall indemnify and save the County harmless from any action arising out of or resulting from deductions hereunder and commenced by an employee against the County (or the County and the Union jointly).\n\nSection 4: The County agrees to use the Local 585 dues billing form for the purposes of remitting Union dues. The County agrees to update this form on a monthly basis by indicating the correct dues rate and initiation fees, adding new applicants and coding employees who may have resigned, retired, died, become promoted or laid off or taken an unpaid leave of absence due to pregnancy, illness, education or military service. The County agrees to deduct any owed Union dues from an employee's pay upon return from said unpaid leave of absence and remit said dues to the Union.\n\nSection 5: The County agrees to continue the Union's COPE checkoff.\n\nARTICLE SEVEN (7)\n\nUNION BUSINESS\n\nSection 1: A Union steward will be permitted to leave his work area after reporting to his respective supervisor and recording his time for the purpose of attending grievance meetings with the County in accordance with the grievance procedure or for the purpose of orally presenting a grievance to the County.

No such material shall be posted which is profane, obscene or defamatory of the County or its representatives, or to any individual, or which constitutes election campaign material.\n\nSection 3: Upon request from an appropriate County official or his designee, the Union will immediately remove any notice or other writing that the County believes violates this section.\n\nSection 4: Any dispute arising out of the terms and provisions of Sections Two (2) and Three (3) above will be subject to the grievance procedure.\n\nSection 5: Add Union Communication Stations at worksites. To be provided by the Union and in places acceptable to the County.\n\nARTICLE NINE (9)\n\nSENIORITY \u2013 PROBATIONARY PERIOD\n\nSection 1: For purposes of this Agreement, seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous service an employee has in the bargaining unit. For purposes of all other entitlements hereunder, excluding pension, seniority shall be based on the employee\u2019s last date of hire with the County. Seniority shall accrue during absence due to illness and other authorized leaves of absence, provided it is not terminated in accordance with Section Two (2) below.\n\nSection 2: An employee\u2019s seniority shall be broken for any of the following reasons:\n\nA. Voluntary termination of employment\n\nB. Discharge for just cause.\n\nC. When recalled from layoff, upon his failure to report to work within a period of forty-eight (48) hours after employee has received notification to so return; provided, however, if the employee notifies the County within said forty-eight (48) hours that he is not immediately available for work, but wishes to remain on the seniority list, he shall be retained on such list for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days. If, however, the employee is unable to return to work because of a physical disability, the County will proceed to recall the most senior qualified employee next on the list. However, such employee shall maintain his position on the recall list up to any break in seniority as defined in this article.\n\nD. Layoffs in excess of twenty-four (24) cumulative months. When an employee who is on layoff is requested to perform work, he shall receive one (1) day of seniority credit for each day he works. Any employee working in such capacity shall not be entitled to any other benefits, rights and entitlements, except as provided for in Article Sixteen (16), Section Four (4) (C). For purposes of illustration, assume that an employee who is on layoff is requested to work and completes ten (10) working days within a twenty-four (24) cumulative month period shall be entitled to ten (10) days of seniority credit which shall be added to the twenty-four (24) cumulative months. Accordingly, said employee would not break his seniority for a period of twenty-four (24) cumulative months plus ten (10) days.\n\nE. Cumulative unpaid leave in excess of twelve (12) months in any (twenty-four (24)) month period except for unpaid union leaves as set forth in Article Nineteen (19), Section Five (5).\n\nF. Cumulative absence due to Woker\u2019s compensable injury in excess of twenty-four (24) months in any thirty-six (36) month period.\nAny employee whose seniority is terminated shall be maintained on a preferential hiring list for two (2) years and if reemployed shall be allocated to the appropriate pay grade at a step commensurate with his length of service less\ntime for months not worked during maintenance on the preferential hiring list, and will be considered a new employee; however, he may purchase his previous years of service for pension entitlement only. No such employee can be reinstated without the County first receiving medical certification as to the employee's ability to return to work.\n\nG. Acceptance of other employment while on authorized leave of absence, including sick leave, unless said employment is authorized in accordance with this Agreement.\n\nH. Any unauthorized absence which exceeds three (3) work days shall be considered an abandonment of employment.\n\nSection 3: When an employee whose continuous service has been broken by any of the above causes is again hired, he shall begin as a new employee of the County.\n\nSection 4: New employees shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first forty-five (45) working days of their employment and shall not be entitled to seniority during that period. Upon completion of this period of forty-five (45) working days, the seniority of such employees, if retained as employees, shall be effective as of the date of their employment as probationary employees. During an employee's probationary period, he shall have no seniority rights and shall not be entitled to any of the other benefits, rights and entitlements of this Agreement. A probationary employee may be summarily dismissed during his probationary period at the sole discretion of the County, and said dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. The Union will not refuse reasonable requests by the County to extend an employee's probationary period. During such extension, an employee is entitled to all benefits, rights, and entitlements of the contract except that dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\n\nAny regular part-time employee who is awarded a regular full-time position and who has already completed his forty-five (45) working day probationary period shall not be required to complete an additional probationary period as described herein. However, such employee shall be required to complete the required thirty (30) working day trial period in Article Fifteen (15), Section Six (6) and/or the orientation period. Notwithstanding Article One (1), Section Three (3) (C) herein to the contrary, the orientation period applicable to any Westmoreland Manor Nursing position shall not count towards fulfilling the forty-five (45) working day probationary period. Employees changing job titles shall not be required to complete another probationary period to become eligible for benefits.\n\nSection 5: Absence due to sickness or accident disability or other approved leave of absence shall not constitute an interruption of continuous service, except as provided in Section Two (2).\n\nSection 6:\n\nA. An employee may exercise his bargaining unit seniority within his own department for the purpose of changing shifts or work weeks solely when an opening occurs within his classification or another shift or work week so long as he has the ability to perform the work involved and the departments operational needs permit such a change.\n\nB. Any employee who laterally bids a shift change within his job classification shall not be permitted another such bid for a period of three (3) months subsequent to the change.\n\nSection 7: The names, dates of hire and job classification of all new persons hired, including temporary employees, shall be furnished to the Union within the first thirty (30) work days of employment. The County shall semi-annually provide the Union with an updated seniority list of employees and their classification.\n\nSection 8: Any employee promoted to a position outside of the unit covered by this Agreement will retain the right to return to his former position, within one (1) year from date of promotion, provided a vacancy exists. Said employee shall be entitled to fill the first such vacancy, notwithstanding Article Sixteen (16) to the contrary. Such employee shall retain all seniority which he accrued prior to the time of his promotion. However, he shall not accrue any seniority for the time spent outside his bargaining unit.\n\nSection 9: Any current employee who had his seniority determined by the drawing of lots shall retain said seniority on that basis. Effective January 1, 1989 any new employees hired on the same date shall\nhave their seniority determined by the last four (4) digits of their social security number (i.e., higher number/highest seniority).\n\nSection 10: Full-time seniority shall prevail over part-time seniority.\n\nARTICLE TEN (10)\nASSIGNMENT OF WORK \u2013 TEMPORARY TRANSFERS\n\nSection 1: All employees shall be required to perform any and all temporarily assigned duties, regardless of their usual or customary duties or job assignment. Temporary transfers shall be made on an equitable basis. A temporary transfer shall not exceed thirty (30) working days, except:\n\nA. To fill a vacancy caused by an employee being on sick or other approved leave of absence;\n\nB. To provide vacation relief scheduling;\n\nC. To fill an opening temporarily pending permanent filling of such opening; or\n\nD. To meet an emergency situation.\n\nSection 2: When an employee is temporarily transferred to another job classification for at least two (2) hours:\n\nA. If the pay grade of such other classification is lower than his regular pay grade, he shall receive his regular pay grade rate.\n\nB. If the pay grade for such other classification is higher than his regular pay grade, he shall be paid the pay grade rate of such other classification at the same step he holds in his regular pay grade except that an employee who is temporarily transferred out of his classification series more than two (2) pay grades higher shall receive either the base rate of that classification or a step in that classification closest to a two (2) step increment, whichever is higher.\n\nSection 3: With the exception of existing seven (7) day a week operations, the work shall be assigned on a five (5) consecutive day per week basis with two (2) consecutive days off. The present method of scheduling employees at Westmoreland Manor shall be maintained.\n\nSection 4: There will be no split shifts unless the County, the Union and the employee mutually agree.\n\nSection 5: The County agrees to maintain its present practices regarding rest breaks during normal work shifts.\n\nSection 6: The practice of summer scheduling in the parks will continue with employees working twelve (12) hours on Saturdays and Sundays and taking a day off during the week. Overtime will continue to be waived for the hours worked on these Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nThe waiver of overtime will only apply to the employees normally scheduled under the summer schedule and not employees scheduled for special events in the parks. The summer schedule will begin with the first weekend in May and conclude with the last weekend in September.\n\nSection 7: The County will adopt the proposed twelve (12) hour schedule for TCO\u2019s on a trial basis for at least three (3) months. At the end of that time period, or any time thereafter, the County reserves the right to return to a schedule it deems necessary. The County will meet and discuss the effect of the schedule change and it\u2019s effective date at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the change in schedule. TCO\u2019s will continue to earn sick time and vacation time at the current accrual rates. Accrued hours will be divided by the length of the shift to determine available sick and vacation days. The value of a personal day will be the length of a shift.\n\nARTICLE ELEVEN (11)\nSHIFT DIFFERENTIAL\n\nSection 1: Throughout the life of this Agreement, the shift differential shall be thirty-five cents ($.35) per hour for the night shift and forty ($.40) cents per hour for the afternoon shift.\nSection 2: For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an employee during the work day shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he is regularly scheduled to start work. Except that any employee who is required to work four (4) or more continuous hours beyond his normal shift and his work time falls within another shift herein, he shall receive the appropriate shift differential pay for all such continuous hours worked in said other shift.\n\nSection 3: Shifts shall be identified in accordance with the following:\n\nA. Day shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 5:00 a.m. and 9:59 a.m., inclusive.\n\nB. Afternoon shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 10:00 a.m. and 4:59 p.m., inclusive.\n\nC. Night shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 5:00 p.m. and 4:59 a.m., inclusive.\n\nSection 4: Shift differential shall be included in the calculation of overtime, holiday and vacation compensation.\n\nSection 5: The work week shall start at 12:01a.m. Monday, except for existing seven (7) day operations where the work week shall commence at 12:01a.m., Sunday.\n\nARTICLE TWELVE (12)\n\nOVERTIME\n\nSection 1: The County shall be the sole judge of the necessity for overtime.\n\nSection 2: The County shall retain the sole and exclusive right to determine work schedules and the number of shifts required.\n\nSection 3: All employees covered in this Agreement shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) hours in one (1) day or forty (40) in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided, except as noted in Article Ten (10), Section Six (6). TCO's will receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided. In the event the twelve (12) hour schedule at 911 is discontinued, the overtime shall be calculated in accordance with Article Twelve (12), Section Three (3).\n\nSection 4: Only hours actually worked shall be counted as time worked in the computation of overtime.\n\nSection 5: Each department shall maintain a record of overtime hours worked by employees within that department subject to the following limitations: Qualified employees within the needed classification shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on the basis of this record, so as to equalize as nearly as practical the opportunity to work overtime within classifications and within departments over a reasonable period of time. As overtime rosters are established in accordance with this provision, senior employees will be placed on top of the list. Ultimately, however, the objective will be to equalize overtime opportunity within a reasonable period of time within departments or section by classification.\n\nThe preceding notwithstanding, it is recognized that where a job is in progress, the most practical manner of assigning overtime will be to hold over qualified employees, within the needed classification, who are working on the shift that precedes the overtime. In such a situation, the above referred to roster would be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees in the needed classification would be held over from the preceding shift to perform the overtime work.\n\nOther situations might occur inwhich the County may have to hold employees over (or inwhich a sufficient number of employees cannot be held over and some additional employees must be called in) and when this occurs, the above referred to roster will be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees, within the department or section and within the needed classifications, shall be called in.\n\nIt is understood that the County retains discretion to determine the number of employees, if any, within each classification that shall be used as overtime; moreover, nothing in this article is intended to restrict the County's right to limit work assignments to qualified employees. Individual departments may continue overtime scheduling practices consistent with operational needs.\nSection 6: In the event an employee is required to work beyond their normal work day and management anticipates that a minimum of four (4) additional hours of work will be required, employees will be given a meal break of one-half (1/2) hour with pay. The meal break shall be scheduled within said four (4) additional hours; however, if management determines, at its sole discretion, that a meal break cannot be scheduled because of the operational needs of the department, the employee shall be paid seven dollars ($7.00) in lieu of said meal break. Said payment shall not be included in the regular rate of pay, nor shall it be included in the calculation of overtime or premium pay. Employees shall be reimbursed in accordance with the existing meal allowance of the County and any improvements thereto.\n\nSection 7: When a situation occurs within the County that imposes a hazard to public safety, it is agreed that any employee shall be assigned to the abatement of that hazard, regardless of whether the work is overtime or not, without violating this Agreement.\n\nSection 8: No employee will unreasonably refuse to work overtime on any day when the necessity for working such overtime arises. The County reserves the right to discipline, suspend or discharge any employee who violates the provisions of this article. The preceding notwithstanding, however, the fact that other qualified employees were available and did perform the necessary overtime shall be given consideration when disciplinary action is contemplated for a refusal to work overtime.\n\nSection 9: Overtime distribution rosters will be posted in each department.\n\nSection 10: Any employee who is required to work on an unscheduled day in his defined work week shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 \u00bd ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such days. These hours shall not be pyramided. This proviso shall not include voluntary schedule changes between and among employees nor the assignment of additional work days within a schedule of less than five (5) days. Accordingly, the County shall not be liable for any overtime payments arising there from. Employees receiving premium pay for working an unscheduled day will forfeit said premium pay if they call off sick and therefore did not work at least forty (40) hours in a week in which the unscheduled day is worked. If the employee presents a doctor\u2019s excuse for the sick day upon his next scheduled work day, they will be paid for the day.\n\nARTICLE THIRTEEN (13)\nCALL-IN PAY\n\nSection 1: An employee who is called in to work at a time when he is not regularly scheduled to report for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at the applicable rate of pay. An employee who is called into work on his regularly scheduled day off shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at one and one-half (1 \u00bd ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such day or days. These hours will not be pyramided. If circumstances beyond the control of the County prohibit an employee or employees from working, the aforementioned guarantee will not apply. If a dispute arises over \u201cbeyond the control of the County\u201d, the matter will be submitted immediately to an arbitrator. Should the arbitration award favor the position of the Union, the County will pay all associated arbitration fees.\n\nSection 2: An employee on regular schedule reporting for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work at the applicable rate of pay.\n\nSection 3: Employees who are scheduled for stand-by time shall be paid seventy dollars ($70.00) per week. Employees scheduled for stand-by time for periods less than one (1) week shall be paid ten dollars ($10.00) per shift that they are on stand-by.\nStand-by time shall apply only to the following departments and classifications:\n\nCoroner\u2019s Office \u2013 Deputy Coroner\n\nIn addition, only one (1) employee per department per work week shall be scheduled for stand-by. If the County determines that a classification or department other than those listed above are needed to be placed on stand-by, they will meet and discuss with the Union prior to implementation.\nARTICLE FOURTEEN (14)\nJOB CLASSIFICATION\n\nThe County will create a job classification system including job descriptions making same available to the Union.\n\nIn the event the Union alleges duties of any existing job(s) are significantly changed, the County shall review the job and provide the Union with the result of said review. In the event the Union disagrees with the implementation of the resulting pay grade assignment, it may file a grievance as set forth in Article Thirty (30) beginning at Step Three (3) (specifically Human Resources Department).\n\nARTICLE FIFTEEN (15)\nPROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS\n\nSection 1: As far as practical, vacancies shall be filled by the promotion of employees already in County service who possess the established minimum qualifications for the positions. The promotion of an employee shall be in recognition of the employee's demonstrated competence to perform more responsible work and shall be based upon his actual assignment to a position of increased difficulty and responsibility. A promotion shall not take place solely on the basis of seniority or primarily to increase an employee's pay.\n\nSection 2: Posting of Vacancies: When a vacancy occurs (other than for a temporary transfer) in the bargaining unit, the County will post notice of such vacancy for a period of ten (10) work days. The notice shall state which job(s) are open, how many openings exist, what qualifications are required, how the bid is to be made and what is the time limit for filling of same.

In the event no employee within the department or office bids, any employee outside of said department, but who is within said Administrative Unit One (1), may bid for the vacancy, provided he possesses the necessary qualifications, skills and ability. In the event the vacancy is not filled in accordance with the foregoing procedure within the ten (10) work day time limit, the County may fill the vacancy from outside the administrative unit.\n\nSection 4: It is understood and agreed that nothing in this article shall diminish or alter the right of the County to direct appropriate transfers and reassignments of employees.\n\nSection 5: In all cases of promotions or filling of vacancies, the County shall have the right to pass over any employee if it establishes that the employee cannot perform the work.\n\nSection 6:\n\nA.

In the event the employee does not qualify within said thirty (30) working day period, he shall be permitted to return to his former job without loss of seniority. Any employee may, within said thirty (30) day period, voluntarily return to his former job without loss of seniority.\n\nC. The Union will not refuse reasonable requests by the County to extend the thirty (30) working day trial period.\nSection 7: If the qualifications of a job vacancy are changed prior to or subsequent to the posting of said vacancy, the County shall notify the Union regarding same.\n\nSection 8: Nothing in this article shall be construed to mean that the County is obligated to temporarily or permanently fill any vacancy or to assign a job or grant a thirty (30) working day trial period to any bidder who does not possess the requisite qualifications. Further, the County reserves the exclusive right to discontinue the trial period after fifteen (15) working days for any bidder it does not consider qualified to fill the vacancy.\n\nSection 9: The County will notify the Union and the affected employee regarding the disposition of all bids.\n\nSection 10: Other than for temporary transfers, no employee will be temporarily assigned to fill a vacancy until such time as the vacancy has been posted in accordance with this article.\n\nSection 11: Any employee who bids and is awarded a position in a higher pay grade shall be paid the pay grade rate of said position at the same step he held in his former pay grade, except that an employee who bids and is awarded a position out of his classification series more than two (2) pay grades higher shall receive either the base rate of that classification or a step in that classification closest to a two (2) step increment, whichever is higher. An example of a class series is Clerk Typist 1, 2, 3; another example is Clerk Steno 1, 2, 3 or Maintenance Worker 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSection 12: Nothing in this article shall be construed to deny the right of any employee to bid on a vacancy in his own pay grade, or in a lower one.\n\nSection 13: An employee who bids and is awarded a position in the same or lower pay grade shall be paid the pay grade of said position at the same step he held in his former position.\n\nSection 14: An employee who is off work on leave of absence or workers' compensation shall be permitted to bid on job vacancies, provided that employee is able to work within two (2) weeks of being awarded the position.

Incumbent Caseworkers/Manor and Aging Care Managers shall receive hourly rate adjustment in accordance with Appendix \"A-1\".\n\n2. The entry rate of pay for Caseworkers/Manor and Aging Care Managers shall be $12.85/hour in the first year of this Agreement, $13.45/hour in the second year of this Agreement, $13.95/hour in the third year of this Agreement and $14.45/hour in the fourth year of this Agreement. *Trainee rate shall be ninety percent (90%) of entry rate.\n\n3. The County shall cover Aging Care Managers/Caseworkers (Manor) with professional liability insurance.\n\nAPPENDIX \"C\"\n\nMANOR MEMORANDUM\n\nIn order to assure proper implementation of the Agreement as it relates to specific areas of concern, including the employees of Westmoreland Manor, the following guidelines are hereby agreed to by the parties hereto:\n\n1. The seniority of Staff and Charge Nurses who bid on Charge Nurse positions shall be based on their last date of hire.\n\n2. Nursing Department schedules shall be prepared annually and issued January 1 of each year. There shall be no changes in said schedules without a one (1) week advance written notice to the affected employee(s). The Nursing Office shall make every effort to provide this notice earlier, if possible.\n\n3. The Manor will provide and designate floor space for placement of a filing cabinet for the exclusive use of the Union.\n\n4. In addition to his regular pay, an employee in the Maintenance Department shall be paid for his one-half (1/2) hour meal break,\npursuant to Article Twelve (12), Section Six (6), even if he has been unable to take the meal period due to the nature of his work assignment.\n\n5. When a nursing vacancy occurs and a regular full-time employee successfully bids from another classification and/or department, the County may temporarily fill the vacancy until the bidder satisfactorily completes the applicable nursing orientation program, at which time said bidder shall be awarded the position subject to the provisions of Article Sixteen (16) hereof.\n\n6. Since temporary employees are excluded from coverage under this Agreement, they shall not accrue seniority for any time spent working in such capacity for bidding purposes under Article Sixteen (16) hereof.\n\n7. When a nursing vacancy occurs, the Manor will post same in accordance with the Labor Agreement. Prior to permanently filling said nursing vacancy, any senior qualified employee may request to laterally transfer to the floor location of the second vacancy created by virtue of the aforementioned lateral transfer. Senior qualified employees shall be given preference. There shall be no further lateral transfers with respect to the nursing vacancy. Requests for transfers will not be unreasonably denied.\n\n8.\nA. Westmoreland Manor shall grant four (4) \"EA\" (excused absence without pay) days per year to employees working in seven (7) day operations.\n\nB. \"EA\" days may be used in single or multiple integers or in connection with vacation periods. However, employees who intend to use their \"EA\" days in connection with a vacation period must notify their Department Head on or before March 1st each year.\n\nC. For those employees who desire to utilize their \"EA\" days in single or multiple integers which are not in connection with a vacation period must notify their Department Head no earlier than two (2) weeks in advance of their requested time off, but in no event shall such notification be later than one (1) week in advance. Individual \"EA\" days shall be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis. Requests made on the same day among two (2) or more employees shall be granted on the basis of seniority, if necessary.\n\nD. \"EA\" days shall not be accumulated from year to year.\n\nE. \"EA\" days shall be scheduled by the Department Head consistent with the staffing of the department.\n\nF. \"EA\" days, single vacation days or personal days may not be scheduled for use between December 15th and January 2nd.\n\nG. Once \"EA\" days are scheduled and approved, they may not be changed except by mutual agreement between the County, employee and Union.\n\n9. LPN's and RN's shall be employed on the salary schedule described in Appendix \"A-1\". RN's with four (4) or more years of RN experience may be hired at Step one (1) on the salary schedule described in Appendix \"A-1\".\n10. The total number of nursing employees to be off for vacation shall be:\n\n8-4 shift      2 RN    2 LPN    7 NA (6 at Christmas)\n4-12 shift     1 RN    1 LPN    6 NA (4 at Christmas)\n12-8 shift     1 RN    1 LPN    4 NA (3 at Christmas)\n\nVacation selection for employees in the Nursing Department shall be by overall bargaining unit seniority. The County shall have the right to pull regular employees and use a temporary employee in their place to provide coverage required by the granting of vacations.\n\nThe minimum number of people who can schedule personal holidays in nursing shall be as follows:\n\n8-4 shift      1 licensed\n              1 non-licensed\n\n4-12 shift     1 employee\n\n12-8 shift     1 employee\n(excludes light duty employee and unit clerks).\n\n11. Employees on Light Duty shall not be counted as part of the Manor's nursing care hours.\n\n12. Any temporary nurse aide who is awarded a regular full time or part time position under this Agreement shall be allocated to step one (1) of the appropriate pay grade.\n\n13. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognized the desire to offer employees at Westmoreland Manor consistent and reasonable schedules including scheduling alternate weekends off, and that the work schedules for employees at Westmoreland Manor must be altered to accommodate this scheduling change. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. agree that the ultimate goal is quality care for the residents of Westmoreland Manor and recognize that staffing directly affects this goal. Therefore, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:\n\nA. Employees at Westmoreland Manor will be scheduled for alternate weekends off. Alternate weekends off will be implemented and maintained according to the following schedule:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date</th>\n    <th>% of Staff on Alternate W/E Schedule</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>7/1/02</td>\n    <td>10%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1/1/03</td>\n    <td>40%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>7/1/03</td>\n    <td>50%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1/1/04</td>\n    <td>70%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>7/1/04</td>\n    <td>90%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1/1/05</td>\n    <td>100%</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nB. If at any point, due to increasing vacancy rates that are expected to last beyond one month, the County reserves the right to schedule employees at every third weekend off. This change in schedule will affect the least senior employees (per classification, per shift) and only the number of employees necessary to affect safe staffing numbers.\nC. Non-Nursing employees hired into slots developed to work every weekend will not be scheduled alternate weekends off.\n\nD. Nursing employees hired into \"12-hour weekend slots or who volunteer to work every weekend will not be scheduled alternate weekends off.\n\nE. The County reserves the right to create some \"2 weekends on/2 weekends off\" slots if this improves the weekend staffing problems. Such positions will be bid.\n\nF. Employees scheduled for alternate weekends may be required to make up any scheduled weekend missed. Weekend shifts missed due to bereavement leave, leave of absence or extended illness will not need to be rescheduled.\n\nG. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments scheduling more than alternate weekends off. For those currently receiving these schedules, such schedules will be maintained unless conditions change which require an alternate weekend schedule to provide necessary services. But where the current schedules impede other employees from receiving alternate weekends off, the County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss the fair implementation of alternate weekend scheduling for the affected employees.\n\nH. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments that, due to small staff numbers and the current complement of full time to part time employees, cannot implement alternate weekend scheduling. The County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss how to improve schedules for those affected employees.\n\n1. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that the successful implementation of scheduling changes will be enhanced by employee participation in the discussion and problem solving for the issues affecting work patterns and how they are impacted by alternate weekend schedules. Therefore, the County and S.E.I.U. will meet to discuss implementation issues and propose ways to meet the needs of the residents of the facility, the economic impact of alternate weekend scheduling and the ultimate goal of offering alternate weekend schedules to all employees. Joint management/union meetings for this purpose shall be scheduled during work time.\nAPPENDIX \"D\"\n\nWESTMORELAND COUNTY\n\nHEPATITIS B INOCULATION POLICY\n\nWestmoreland County has decided to provide Hepatitis B inoculations to at risk employees and to follow up the three (3) shot series with a blood test to determine the result. Employees will be given the inoculations free of charge if they complete the series. Those employees who start the series and do not complete it in the recommended time frame will be charged the contracted rate of $36.66 per shot received. This could amount to $73.32 for employees who receive the first two (2) shots and do not follow up with their third (3rd) inoculation.\n\nAll shots are scheduled in advance at a location and time that is announced (usually at Westmoreland Manor). If an employee is unable to attend the scheduled inoculation, they must notify their supervisor immediately who will then contact the Human Resources Department. These employees will be instructed to report to Med. Care in Youngwood for their inoculation. Those employees receiving shots at Med Care must do so within two (2) days of the missed scheduled day. Employees receiving their shot at Med Care for whatever reason, will be required to pay for the cost of the office visit and will not be reimbursed for this. Westmoreland County will provide Med Care with the needed serum. Employees with valid and documented medical reasons for not continuing with the series of shots will be exempt from this policy. Employees leaving the employment of Westmoreland County prior to completion of the series will have the cost of the shots received deducted from their final pay.\n\nI ____________________________ have read the above policy and agree to its terms and conditions. By signing this I knowingly give Westmoreland County permission to deduct the above cost from my paycheck in accordance with this policy.\n\nEMPLOYEE SIGNATURE _______________ DATE _______________\n\nWITNESS SIGNATURE _______________ DATE _______________\n2005 SALARY SCHEDULE\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>GRADE</th>\n    <th>ST1</th>\n    <th>ST2</th>\n    <th>ST3</th>\n    <th>ST4</th>\n    <th>ST5</th>\n    <th>ST6</th>\n    <th>ST7</th>\n    <th>ST8</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr><td>2</td><td>10.64</td><td>10.96</td><td>11.09</td><td>11.32</td><td>11.56</td><td>11.81</td><td>12.06</td><td>12.33</td><td>12.60</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>3</td><td>10.82</td><td>11.05</td><td>11.28</td><td>11.52</td><td>11.76</td><td>12.02</td><td>12.29</td><td>12.55</td><td>12.83</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>4</td><td>11.00</td><td>11.23</td><td>11.47</td><td>11.71</td><td>11.97</td><td>12.23</td><td>12.49</td><td>12.77</td><td>13.05</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>5</td><td>11.18</td><td>11.43</td><td>11.67</td><td>11.92</td><td>12.18</td><td>12.45</td><td>12.72</td><td>13.00</td><td>13.29</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>6</td><td>11.36</td><td>11.62</td><td>11.87</td><td>12.13</td><td>12.39</td><td>12.67</td><td>12.85</td><td>13.24</td><td>13.54</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7</td><td>11.58</td><td>11.83</td><td>12.08</td><td>12.36</td><td>12.62</td><td>12.90</td><td>13.19</td><td>13.48</td><td>13.79</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8</td><td>11.80</td><td>12.06</td><td>12.32</td><td>12.59</td><td>12.87</td><td>13.15</td><td>13.45</td><td>13.75</td><td>14.07</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>9</td><td>12.00</td><td>12.28</td><td>12.55</td><td>12.84</td><td>13.13</td><td>13.42</td><td>13.72</td><td>14.04</td><td>14.38</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>10</td><td>12.27</td><td>12.54</td><td>12.82</td><td>13.10</td><td>13.40</td><td>13.70</td><td>14.01</td><td>14.33</td><td>14.66</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>11</td><td>12.52</td><td>12.80</td><td>13.08</td><td>13.37</td><td>13.68</td><td>13.99</td><td>14.31</td><td>14.64</td><td>14.98</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>12</td><td>12.80</td><td>13.08</td><td>13.36</td><td>13.66</td><td>13.99</td><td>14.31</td><td>14.64</td><td>14.98</td><td>15.33</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>13</td><td>13.11</td><td>13.39</td><td>13.70</td><td>14.01</td><td>14.33</td><td>14.66</td><td>15.00</td><td>15.35</td><td>15.71</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>14</td><td>13.46</td><td>13.78</td><td>14.08</td><td>14.40</td><td>14.74</td><td>15.08</td><td>15.43</td><td>15.80</td><td>16.17</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>15</td><td>13.90</td><td>14.11</td><td>14.41</td><td>14.72</td><td>15.12</td><td>15.47</td><td>15.84</td><td>16.21</td><td>16.59</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>16</td><td>14.18</td><td>14.51</td><td>14.84</td><td>15.18</td><td>15.53</td><td>15.91</td><td>16.29</td><td>16.68</td><td>17.08</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>17</td><td>14.56</td><td>14.90</td><td>15.23</td><td>15.60</td><td>15.97</td><td>16.35</td><td>16.73</td><td>17.13</td><td>17.55</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>IS1</th><td>15.68</td><td>15.98</td><td>16.28</td><td>16.60</td><td>16.94</td><td>17.28</td><td>17.63</td><td>18.00</td><td>18.37</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>IS2</th><td>16.58</td><td>16.91</td><td>17.24</td><td>17.59</td><td>17.95</td><td>18.31</td><td>18.69</td><td>19.06</td><td>19.48</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>IS3</th><td>17.93</td><td>18.27</td><td>18.62</td><td>18.98</td><td>19.35</td><td>19.73</td><td>20.12</td><td>20.53</td><td>20.95</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>PL</th><td>19.46</td><td>19.85</td><td>20.25</td><td>20.66</td><td>21.08</td><td>21.52</td><td>21.97</td><td>22.43</td><td>22.91</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>STFF/PN</th><td>17.75</td><td>18.07</td><td>18.40</td><td>18.75</td><td>19.10</td><td>19.47</td><td>19.84</td><td>20.23</td><td>20.63</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>STFF/RN</th><td>22.00</td><td>22.39</td><td>22.80</td><td>23.23</td><td>23.66</td><td>24.11</td><td>24.57</td><td>25.05</td><td>25.54</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>RCN</th><td>22.99</td><td>23.78</td><td>23.22</td><td>23.65</td><td>24.10</td><td>24.56</td><td>25.04</td><td>25.53</td><td>26.04</td></tr>\n  <tr><th>RCN4</th><td>22.71</td><td>23.12</td><td>23.56</td><td>24.00</td><td>24.46</td><td>24.93</td><td>25.42</td><td>25.92</td><td>26.44</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nThe starting salary for Graduate PN and Graduate Nurse shall be $17.15/hr. and $21.32/hr. respectively.\nThe starting rate for Aging Care Managers/Caseworkers shall be $14.45/hr.
