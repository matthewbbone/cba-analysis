ARTICLE NINE (9)

SENIORITY – PROBATIONARY PERIOD

Section 1: For purposes of this Agreement, seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous service an employee has in the bargaining unit. For purposes of all other entitlements hereunder, excluding pension, seniority shall be based on the employee’s last date of hire with the County. Seniority shall accrue during absence due to illness and other authorized leaves of absence, provided it is not terminated in accordance with Section Two (2) below.

Section 2: An employee’s seniority shall be broken for any of the following reasons:

A. Voluntary termination of employment

B. Discharge for just cause.

C. When recalled from layoff, upon his failure to report to work within a period of forty-eight (48) hours after employee has received notification to so return; provided, however, if the employee notifies the County within said forty-eight (48) hours that he is not immediately available for work, but wishes to remain on the seniority list, he shall be retained on such list for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days. If, however, the employee is unable to return to work because of a physical disability, the County will proceed to recall the most senior qualified employee next on the list. However, such employee shall maintain his position on the recall list up to any break in seniority as defined in this article.

D. Layoffs in excess of twenty-four (24) cumulative months. When an employee who is on layoff is requested to perform work, he shall receive one (1) day of seniority credit for each day he works. Any employee working in such capacity shall not be entitled to any other benefits, rights and entitlements, except as provided for in Article Sixteen (16), Section Four (4) (C). For purposes of illustration, assume that an employee who is on layoff is requested to work and completes ten (10) working days within a twenty-four (24) cumulative month period shall be entitled to ten (10) days of seniority credit which shall be added to the twenty-four (24) cumulative months. Accordingly, said employee would not break his seniority for a period of twenty-four (24) cumulative months plus ten (10) days.

E. Cumulative unpaid leave in excess of twelve (12) months in any (twenty-four (24)) month period except for unpaid union leaves as set forth in Article Nineteen (19), Section Five (5).

F. Cumulative absence due to Woker’s compensable injury in excess of twenty-four (24) months in any thirty-six (36) month period.
Any employee whose seniority is terminated shall be maintained on a preferential hiring list for two (2) years and if reemployed shall be allocated to the appropriate pay grade at a step commensurate with his length of service less
