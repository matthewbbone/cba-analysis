Appeal Procedure or this contract grievance procedure. If an appeal is filed under the Civil Service Appeal Procedure, the employee shall not be entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure, all rights to do so being waived by the exercise of an option by the employee to utilize the Civil Service Procedure.

DEFINITION: A grievance is a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or alleged violation of a specific term or provision of this Agreement.

Section 1: Any employee is entitled to select an accredited representative of the Union to represent him during all steps of the grievance procedure, which is as follows:

FIRST STEP – IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR. An employee with a grievance shall discuss it with his immediate Supervisor within seven (7) calendar days of its occurrence or his knowledge of same. The Supervisor shall attempt to resolve the grievance to the mutual satisfaction of the employee and management within five (5) work days of its presentation. The Supervisor shall report his decision to the employee in writing. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Second Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

SECOND STEP – HEAD OF DEPARTMENT. If the employee is not satisfied with the disposition of his grievance after discussion with his Immediate Supervisor, he may submit a written appeal to the Department Head within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the First Step or within not less than five (5) work days nor more than ten (10) work days after the grievance was presented at the First Step. The Department Head, within five (5) work days after receiving the appeal, shall meet with the employee in an attempt to resolve the grievance. The Department Head shall give the employee a written decision within five (5) work days following the meeting. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Third Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

THIRD STEP – COMMISSIONER’S DESIGNEE AND/OR ELECTED OFFICIAL. If the employee is not satisfied with the disposition of his grievance at the Second Step, he may submit a written appeal to the designee of the Commissioners and Elected Official, if applicable, within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the Second Step or within not less than ten (10) work days nor more than fifteen (15) work days after the grievance was presented at the Second Step. The Designee and Elected Official, if applicable, within ten (10) work days following the hearing, shall give the employee a written decision. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Fourth Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

FOURTH STEP – ARBITRATION. If the Union is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at the Third Step, it may appeal to arbitration within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the Third Step or in not less than twenty (20) work days nor more than twenty-five (25) work days after the grievance was presented at the Third Step. A request for arbitration may be initiated by the Union serving upon the County a notice in writing of an intent to proceed to arbitration. The notice shall identify the agreement provision in dispute, the issue(s) to be determined and the employee or employees involved. Upon receipt of a notice requesting arbitration, the parties shall meet to select an arbitrator; if the parties cannot voluntarily agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, they shall notify the State Bureau of Mediation of their inability to do so. Pursuant to Section 903.1 of Act 195, the State Bureau of Mediation shall then submit to the parties the names of seven (7) arbitrators. Each party shall alternately strike a name until one (1) name remains. The County shall strike the first name. The person remaining shall be the arbitrator.

A. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to, subtract from or modify the provisions of this Agreement in arriving at a decision of the issue or issues presented and shall confine his decision solely to the application and interpretation of this Agreement. The decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, with the proviso that any decisions of the arbitrator or arbitrators requiring legislation will only be effective if such legislation is enacted.
