ARTICLE FOURTEEN (14)
JOB CLASSIFICATION

The County will create a job classification system including job descriptions making same available to the Union.

In the event the Union alleges duties of any existing job(s) are significantly changed, the County shall review the job and provide the Union with the result of said review. In the event the Union disagrees with the implementation of the resulting pay grade assignment, it may file a grievance as set forth in Article Thirty (30) beginning at Step Three (3) (specifically Human Resources Department).

ARTICLE FIFTEEN (15)
PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS

Section 1: As far as practical, vacancies shall be filled by the promotion of employees already in County service who possess the established minimum qualifications for the positions. The promotion of an employee shall be in recognition of the employee's demonstrated competence to perform more responsible work and shall be based upon his actual assignment to a position of increased difficulty and responsibility. A promotion shall not take place solely on the basis of seniority or primarily to increase an employee's pay.

Section 2: Posting of Vacancies: When a vacancy occurs (other than for a temporary transfer) in the bargaining unit, the County will post notice of such vacancy for a period of ten (10) work days. The notice shall state which job(s) are open, how many openings exist, what qualifications are required, how the bid is to be made and what is the time limit for filling of same. The County and Union discourage the costly practice of indiscriminate bidding for individual convenience or temporary advantage. Employees who wish to apply for the vacancy shall indicate, in writing, their qualifications for the job on the official County bid form and shall file their bid within the prescribed time limit.

The County shall fill vacancies within forty (40) days of posting (one hundred (100) days for vacancies in the Manor Nursing department) in accordance with the requirements of the contract.

Section 3: Any employee who works in a department or office in Administrative Unit One (1) where a vacancy occurs will be given first preference on bidding for the vacancy, provided he possesses the necessary qualifications, skills and ability. In the event no employee within the department or office bids, any employee outside of said department, but who is within said Administrative Unit One (1), may bid for the vacancy, provided he possesses the necessary qualifications, skills and ability. In the event the vacancy is not filled in accordance with the foregoing procedure within the ten (10) work day time limit, the County may fill the vacancy from outside the administrative unit.

Section 4: It is understood and agreed that nothing in this article shall diminish or alter the right of the County to direct appropriate transfers and reassignments of employees.

Section 5: In all cases of promotions or filling of vacancies, the County shall have the right to pass over any employee if it establishes that the employee cannot perform the work.

Section 6:

A. Any employee who is awarded a vacancy shall be subject to a thirty (30) working day trial period in which he must demonstrate that he possesses the requisite skills and ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position.

B. In the event the employee does not qualify within said thirty (30) working day period, he shall be permitted to return to his former job without loss of seniority. Any employee may, within said thirty (30) day period, voluntarily return to his former job without loss of seniority.

C. The Union will not refuse reasonable requests by the County to extend the thirty (30) working day trial period.
