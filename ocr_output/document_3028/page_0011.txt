Section 2: For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an employee during the work day shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he is regularly scheduled to start work.

ARTICLE TWELVE (12)

OVERTIME

Section 1: The County shall be the sole judge of the necessity for overtime.

Section 2: The County shall retain the sole and exclusive right to determine work schedules and the number of shifts required.

Section 3: All employees covered in this Agreement shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) hours in one (1) day or forty (40) in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided, except as noted in Article Ten (10), Section Six (6). TCO's will receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided. In the event the twelve (12) hour schedule at 911 is discontinued, the overtime shall be calculated in accordance with Article Twelve (12), Section Three (3).

Section 4: Only hours actually worked shall be counted as time worked in the computation of overtime.

Section 5: Each department shall maintain a record of overtime hours worked by employees within that department subject to the following limitations: Qualified employees within the needed classification shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on the basis of this record, so as to equalize as nearly as practical the opportunity to work overtime within classifications and within departments over a reasonable period of time. As overtime rosters are established in accordance with this provision, senior employees will be placed on top of the list. Ultimately, however, the objective will be to equalize overtime opportunity within a reasonable period of time within departments or section by classification.

The preceding notwithstanding, it is recognized that where a job is in progress, the most practical manner of assigning overtime will be to hold over qualified employees, within the needed classification, who are working on the shift that precedes the overtime. In such a situation, the above referred to roster would be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees in the needed classification would be held over from the preceding shift to perform the overtime work.

Other situations might occur inwhich the County may have to hold employees over (or inwhich a sufficient number of employees cannot be held over and some additional employees must be called in) and when this occurs, the above referred to roster will be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees, within the department or section and within the needed classifications, shall be called in.

It is understood that the County retains discretion to determine the number of employees, if any, within each classification that shall be used as overtime; moreover, nothing in this article is intended to restrict the County's right to limit work assignments to qualified employees. Individual departments may continue overtime scheduling practices consistent with operational needs.
