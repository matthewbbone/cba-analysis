PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to continually promote harmonious and cooperative relationships subject, however, to the paramount right of the public to keep inviolate the guarantees for their health, safety and welfare. Unresolved disputes between the County and the Union are injurious to the public and both parties, therefore, are aware that adequate means must be established for minimizing them and providing for their resolution. The County and the Union agree that this overall policy may be best accomplished by negotiating in good faith and entering into written agreements evidencing the result of such negotiations and by establishing procedures to provide for the protection of the County and its employees and to insure to the public orderly and uninterrupted services.

ARTICLE ONE (1)

A. A "full-time employee" is defined herein as any employee who is hired to fill a permanent position and who is normally scheduled to work more than forty-nine (49) hours within a pay period and who has successfully completed the probationary period prescribed in this Agreement. Any regular full-time employee currently working forty-nine (49) hours shall not lose their full-time status as a result of this language change.

B. A "probationary employee" is defined herein as any employee who is hired by the County to fill a vacant or newly created permanent bargaining unit position and who is in the process of completing the probationary period prescribed in the Agreement.

C. Temporary employees are excluded from coverage under this Agreement. A "temporary employee" is defined herein as any person who is hired as a replacement for a full-time or regular part-time employee who is on sick leave or other approved leave of absence and who is expected to return to employment or someone who is hired for a specific non-recurring task for a fixed period of time.

The seniority date of regular part-time employees, employed by the County as of January 1, 1989 shall be established
prospectively from January 1, 1989. In addition, said employee shall be required to complete the probationary period prescribed herein prospective from January 1, 1989. The County shall not create part-time positions for the purpose of eliminating full-time positions.
In the event a full-time employee is expected to be absent for three (3) or more days, the senior part-time employee who is available shall be offered the additional work prior to it being offered to temporary employees; however, this provision shall not require the County to assign overtime work to part-time employees. Such additional work shall not be considered as regularly scheduled work.

Section 4: The use of the term "retirement" in this Agreement shall be defined as sixty (60) years of age or upwards, except as applied to a contributor who has completed twenty (20) years of total County service, in which case, it shall be fifty-five (55) years of age or upwards. Further, if a contributor, after five (5) years of service as a County employee and before reaching superannuation retirement age is permanently disabled while in service and is unable to continue as a County employee, as verified by medical examination, shall be considered retired under the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any other type of retirement, as may be defined under the County Pension Law, Act 96 of August 31, 1971, as may be amended, shall not be construed as a 'retirement' under the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE TWO (2)

MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

Section 5: Add Union Communication Stations at worksites. To be provided by the Union and in places acceptable to the County.

ARTICLE NINE (9)

SENIORITY – PROBATIONARY PERIOD

Section 1: For purposes of this Agreement, seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous service an employee has in the bargaining unit. For purposes of all other entitlements hereunder, excluding pension, seniority shall be based on the employee’s last date of hire with the County. Seniority shall accrue during absence due to illness and other authorized leaves of absence, provided it is not terminated in accordance with Section Two (2) below.

Section 2: An employee’s seniority shall be broken for any of the following reasons:

A. Voluntary termination of employment

B. Discharge for just cause.

C. When recalled from layoff, upon his failure to report to work within a period of forty-eight (48) hours after employee has received notification to so return; provided, however, if the employee notifies the County within said forty-eight (48) hours that he is not immediately available for work, but wishes to remain on the seniority list, he shall be retained on such list for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days. If, however, the employee is unable to return to work because of a physical disability, the County will proceed to recall the most senior qualified employee next on the list. However, such employee shall maintain his position on the recall list up to any break in seniority as defined in this article.

D. Layoffs in excess of twenty-four (24) cumulative months. When an employee who is on layoff is requested to perform work, he shall receive one (1) day of seniority credit for each day he works. Any employee working in such capacity shall not be entitled to any other benefits, rights and entitlements, except as provided for in Article Sixteen (16), Section Four (4) (C). For purposes of illustration, assume that an employee who is on layoff is requested to work and completes ten (10) working days within a twenty-four (24) cumulative month period shall be entitled to ten (10) days of seniority credit which shall be added to the twenty-four (24) cumulative months. Accordingly, said employee would not break his seniority for a period of twenty-four (24) cumulative months plus ten (10) days.

E. Cumulative unpaid leave in excess of twelve (12) months in any (twenty-four (24)) month period except for unpaid union leaves as set forth in Article Nineteen (19), Section Five (5).

F. Cumulative absence due to Woker’s compensable injury in excess of twenty-four (24) months in any thirty-six (36) month period.
Any employee whose seniority is terminated shall be maintained on a preferential hiring list for two (2) years and if reemployed shall be allocated to the appropriate pay grade at a step commensurate with his length of service less
time for months not worked during maintenance on the preferential hiring list, and will be considered a new employee; however, he may purchase his previous years of service for pension entitlement only. No such employee can be reinstated without the County first receiving medical certification as to the employee's ability to return to work.

G. Acceptance of other employment while on authorized leave of absence, including sick leave, unless said employment is authorized in accordance with this Agreement.

H. Any unauthorized absence which exceeds three (3) work days shall be considered an abandonment of employment.

Section 3: When an employee whose continuous service has been broken by any of the above causes is again hired, he shall begin as a new employee of the County.

Section 4: New employees shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first forty-five (45) working days of their employment and shall not be entitled to seniority during that period. Upon completion of this period of forty-five (45) working days, the seniority of such employees, if retained as employees, shall be effective as of the date of their employment as probationary employees. During an employee's probationary period, he shall have no seniority rights and shall not be entitled to any of the other benefits, rights and entitlements of this Agreement. A probationary employee may be summarily dismissed during his probationary period at the sole discretion of the County, and said dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. The Union will not refuse reasonable requests by the County to extend an employee's probationary period. During such extension, an employee is entitled to all benefits, rights, and entitlements of the contract except that dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

Any regular part-time employee who is awarded a regular full-time position and who has already completed his forty-five (45) working day probationary period shall not be required to complete an additional probationary period as described herein. However, such employee shall be required to complete the required thirty (30) working day trial period in Article Fifteen (15), Section Six (6) and/or the orientation period. Notwithstanding Article One (1), Section Three (3) (C) herein to the contrary, the orientation period applicable to any Westmoreland Manor Nursing position shall not count towards fulfilling the forty-five (45) working day probationary period. Employees changing job titles shall not be required to complete another probationary period to become eligible for benefits.

Section 5: Absence due to sickness or accident disability or other approved leave of absence shall not constitute an interruption of continuous service, except as provided in Section Two (2).

Section 6:

A. An employee may exercise his bargaining unit seniority within his own department for the purpose of changing shifts or work weeks solely when an opening occurs within his classification or another shift or work week so long as he has the ability to perform the work involved and the departments operational needs permit such a change.

B. Any employee who laterally bids a shift change within his job classification shall not be permitted another such bid for a period of three (3) months subsequent to the change.

Section 7: The names, dates of hire and job classification of all new persons hired, including temporary employees, shall be furnished to the Union within the first thirty (30) work days of employment. The County shall semi-annually provide the Union with an updated seniority list of employees and their classification.

Section 8: Any employee promoted to a position outside of the unit covered by this Agreement will retain the right to return to his former position, within one (1) year from date of promotion, provided a vacancy exists. Said employee shall be entitled to fill the first such vacancy, notwithstanding Article Sixteen (16) to the contrary. Such employee shall retain all seniority which he accrued prior to the time of his promotion. However, he shall not accrue any seniority for the time spent outside his bargaining unit.

Section 9: Any current employee who had his seniority determined by the drawing of lots shall retain said seniority on that basis. Effective January 1, 1989 any new employees hired on the same date shall
have their seniority determined by the last four (4) digits of their social security number (i.e., higher number/highest seniority).

Section 10: Full-time seniority shall prevail over part-time seniority.

ARTICLE TEN (10)
ASSIGNMENT OF WORK – TEMPORARY TRANSFERS

Section 1: All employees shall be required to perform any and all temporarily assigned duties, regardless of their usual or customary duties or job assignment. Temporary transfers shall be made on an equitable basis. A temporary transfer shall not exceed thirty (30) working days, except:

A. To fill a vacancy caused by an employee being on sick or other approved leave of absence;

B. To provide vacation relief scheduling;

C. To fill an opening temporarily pending permanent filling of such opening; or

D. To meet an emergency situation.

Section 2: When an employee is temporarily transferred to another job classification for at least two (2) hours:

A. If the pay grade of such other classification is lower than his regular pay grade, he shall receive his regular pay grade rate.

B. If the pay grade for such other classification is higher than his regular pay grade, he shall be paid the pay grade rate of such other classification at the same step he holds in his regular pay grade except that an employee who is temporarily transferred out of his classification series more than two (2) pay grades higher shall receive either the base rate of that classification or a step in that classification closest to a two (2) step increment, whichever is higher.

Section 3: With the exception of existing seven (7) day a week operations, the work shall be assigned on a five (5) consecutive day per week basis with two (2) consecutive days off. The present method of scheduling employees at Westmoreland Manor shall be maintained.

Section 4: There will be no split shifts unless the County, the Union and the employee mutually agree.

Section 5: The County agrees to maintain its present practices regarding rest breaks during normal work shifts.

Section 6: The practice of summer scheduling in the parks will continue with employees working twelve (12) hours on Saturdays and Sundays and taking a day off during the week. Overtime will continue to be waived for the hours worked on these Saturdays and Sundays.

The waiver of overtime will only apply to the employees normally scheduled under the summer schedule and not employees scheduled for special events in the parks. The summer schedule will begin with the first weekend in May and conclude with the last weekend in September.

Section 7: The County will adopt the proposed twelve (12) hour schedule for TCO’s on a trial basis for at least three (3) months. At the end of that time period, or any time thereafter, the County reserves the right to return to a schedule it deems necessary. The County will meet and discuss the effect of the schedule change and it’s effective date at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the change in schedule. TCO’s will continue to earn sick time and vacation time at the current accrual rates. Accrued hours will be divided by the length of the shift to determine available sick and vacation days. The value of a personal day will be the length of a shift.

Section 2: For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an employee during the work day shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he is regularly scheduled to start work. Except that any employee who is required to work four (4) or more continuous hours beyond his normal shift and his work time falls within another shift herein, he shall receive the appropriate shift differential pay for all such continuous hours worked in said other shift.

ARTICLE TWELVE (12)

OVERTIME

Section 1: The County shall be the sole judge of the necessity for overtime.

Section 2: The County shall retain the sole and exclusive right to determine work schedules and the number of shifts required.

Section 3: All employees covered in this Agreement shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) hours in one (1) day or forty (40) in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided, except as noted in Article Ten (10), Section Six (6). TCO's will receive time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided. In the event the twelve (12) hour schedule at 911 is discontinued, the overtime shall be calculated in accordance with Article Twelve (12), Section Three (3).

Section 4: Only hours actually worked shall be counted as time worked in the computation of overtime.

Section 5: Each department shall maintain a record of overtime hours worked by employees within that department subject to the following limitations: Qualified employees within the needed classification shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on the basis of this record, so as to equalize as nearly as practical the opportunity to work overtime within classifications and within departments over a reasonable period of time. As overtime rosters are established in accordance with this provision, senior employees will be placed on top of the list. Ultimately, however, the objective will be to equalize overtime opportunity within a reasonable period of time within departments or section by classification.

The preceding notwithstanding, it is recognized that where a job is in progress, the most practical manner of assigning overtime will be to hold over qualified employees, within the needed classification, who are working on the shift that precedes the overtime. In such a situation, the above referred to roster would be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees in the needed classification would be held over from the preceding shift to perform the overtime work.

Other situations might occur inwhich the County may have to hold employees over (or inwhich a sufficient number of employees cannot be held over and some additional employees must be called in) and when this occurs, the above referred to roster will be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees, within the department or section and within the needed classifications, shall be called in.

It is understood that the County retains discretion to determine the number of employees, if any, within each classification that shall be used as overtime; moreover, nothing in this article is intended to restrict the County's right to limit work assignments to qualified employees. Individual departments may continue overtime scheduling practices consistent with operational needs.
Section 6: In the event an employee is required to work beyond their normal work day and management anticipates that a minimum of four (4) additional hours of work will be required, employees will be given a meal break of one-half (1/2) hour with pay. The meal break shall be scheduled within said four (4) additional hours; however, if management determines, at its sole discretion, that a meal break cannot be scheduled because of the operational needs of the department, the employee shall be paid seven dollars ($7.00) in lieu of said meal break. Said payment shall not be included in the regular rate of pay, nor shall it be included in the calculation of overtime or premium pay. Employees shall be reimbursed in accordance with the existing meal allowance of the County and any improvements thereto.

Section 7: When a situation occurs within the County that imposes a hazard to public safety, it is agreed that any employee shall be assigned to the abatement of that hazard, regardless of whether the work is overtime or not, without violating this Agreement.

Section 8: No employee will unreasonably refuse to work overtime on any day when the necessity for working such overtime arises. The County reserves the right to discipline, suspend or discharge any employee who violates the provisions of this article. The preceding notwithstanding, however, the fact that other qualified employees were available and did perform the necessary overtime shall be given consideration when disciplinary action is contemplated for a refusal to work overtime.

Section 9: Overtime distribution rosters will be posted in each department.

Section 10: Any employee who is required to work on an unscheduled day in his defined work week shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 ½ ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such days. These hours shall not be pyramided. This proviso shall not include voluntary schedule changes between and among employees nor the assignment of additional work days within a schedule of less than five (5) days. Accordingly, the County shall not be liable for any overtime payments arising there from. Employees receiving premium pay for working an unscheduled day will forfeit said premium pay if they call off sick and therefore did not work at least forty (40) hours in a week in which the unscheduled day is worked. If the employee presents a doctor’s excuse for the sick day upon his next scheduled work day, they will be paid for the day.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN (13)
CALL-IN PAY

Section 1: An employee who is called in to work at a time when he is not regularly scheduled to report for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at the applicable rate of pay. An employee who is called into work on his regularly scheduled day off shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work and/or pay at one and one-half (1 ½ ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such day or days. These hours will not be pyramided. If circumstances beyond the control of the County prohibit an employee or employees from working, the aforementioned guarantee will not apply. If a dispute arises over “beyond the control of the County”, the matter will be submitted immediately to an arbitrator. Should the arbitration award favor the position of the Union, the County will pay all associated arbitration fees.

Section 2: An employee on regular schedule reporting for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work at the applicable rate of pay.

Section 3: Employees who are scheduled for stand-by time shall be paid seventy dollars ($70.00) per week. Employees scheduled for stand-by time for periods less than one (1) week shall be paid ten dollars ($10.00) per shift that they are on stand-by.
Stand-by time shall apply only to the following departments and classifications:

Coroner’s Office – Deputy Coroner

In addition, only one (1) employee per department per work week shall be scheduled for stand-by. If the County determines that a classification or department other than those listed above are needed to be placed on stand-by, they will meet and discuss with the Union prior to implementation.

PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS

Section 9: The County will notify the Union and the affected employee regarding the disposition of all bids.

Appeal Procedure or this contract grievance procedure. If an appeal is filed under the Civil Service Appeal Procedure, the employee shall not be entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure, all rights to do so being waived by the exercise of an option by the employee to utilize the Civil Service Procedure.

DEFINITION: A grievance is a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or alleged violation of a specific term or provision of this Agreement.

Section 1: Any employee is entitled to select an accredited representative of the Union to represent him during all steps of the grievance procedure, which is as follows:

FIRST STEP – IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR. An employee with a grievance shall discuss it with his immediate Supervisor within seven (7) calendar days of its occurrence or his knowledge of same. The Supervisor shall attempt to resolve the grievance to the mutual satisfaction of the employee and management within five (5) work days of its presentation. The Supervisor shall report his decision to the employee in writing. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Second Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

SECOND STEP – HEAD OF DEPARTMENT. If the employee is not satisfied with the disposition of his grievance after discussion with his Immediate Supervisor, he may submit a written appeal to the Department Head within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the First Step or within not less than five (5) work days nor more than ten (10) work days after the grievance was presented at the First Step. The Department Head, within five (5) work days after receiving the appeal, shall meet with the employee in an attempt to resolve the grievance. The Department Head shall give the employee a written decision within five (5) work days following the meeting. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Third Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

THIRD STEP – COMMISSIONER’S DESIGNEE AND/OR ELECTED OFFICIAL. If the employee is not satisfied with the disposition of his grievance at the Second Step, he may submit a written appeal to the designee of the Commissioners and Elected Official, if applicable, within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the Second Step or within not less than ten (10) work days nor more than fifteen (15) work days after the grievance was presented at the Second Step. The Designee and Elected Official, if applicable, within ten (10) work days following the hearing, shall give the employee a written decision. If the employee does not proceed with his grievance to the Fourth Step within the time limits prescribed in the following subsection and no extension of time is granted, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.

FOURTH STEP – ARBITRATION. If the Union is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at the Third Step, it may appeal to arbitration within five (5) work days after receiving a decision at the Third Step or in not less than twenty (20) work days nor more than twenty-five (25) work days after the grievance was presented at the Third Step. A request for arbitration may be initiated by the Union serving upon the County a notice in writing of an intent to proceed to arbitration. The notice shall identify the agreement provision in dispute, the issue(s) to be determined and the employee or employees involved. Upon receipt of a notice requesting arbitration, the parties shall meet to select an arbitrator; if the parties cannot voluntarily agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, they shall notify the State Bureau of Mediation of their inability to do so. Pursuant to Section 903.1 of Act 195, the State Bureau of Mediation shall then submit to the parties the names of seven (7) arbitrators. Each party shall alternately strike a name until one (1) name remains. The County shall strike the first name. The person remaining shall be the arbitrator.

A. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to, subtract from or modify the provisions of this Agreement in arriving at a decision of the issue or issues presented and shall confine his decision solely to the application and interpretation of this Agreement. The decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, with the proviso that any decisions of the arbitrator or arbitrators requiring legislation will only be effective if such legislation is enacted.
B. The costs of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting its own case.

Section 2: If the County fails to adhere to the time limitations at any step in the grievance procedure and a time extension has not been granted by the Union to the County, the Union shall have the right to advance the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure.

Section 3: A grievance which affects a substantial number of employees may be presented initially by the Union at Step three (3) of the grievance procedure. The Union shall designate one (1) spokesman to act as representative for the group.

Section 4: A grievance may be withdrawn by the Union or the aggrieved employee at any time, and the withdrawal of any grievance shall not be prejudicial to the positions taken by the parties as they relate to that grievance or any future grievance.

Section 5: The time limits set forth in the grievance procedure shall, unless extended by mutual written agreement of the County and the Union, be binding and any grievance not timely presented, or timely processed thereafter, shall not be considered a grievance under this Agreement and shall not be arbitrable.

Section 6: Nothing in this Agreement prohibits an employee from personally bringing matters of personal concern to the attention of the appropriate officials of the County.

Section 7: Any individual employee or group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to the County and to have them adjusted without the intervention of the Union as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this collective bargaining agreement and, provided further, that the Union has been given an opportunity to be present at such adjustment. The County may notify an aggrieved employee (with copy to Union) of its decision by certified mail sent to the employee's last known address, and this shall fulfill the decision notification requirements as set forth in any step of the grievance procedure described herein.

When a nursing vacancy occurs and a regular full-time employee successfully bids from another classification and/or department, the County may temporarily fill the vacancy until the bidder satisfactorily completes the applicable nursing orientation program, at which time said bidder shall be awarded the position subject to the provisions of Article Sixteen (16) hereof.

6. Since temporary employees are excluded from coverage under this Agreement, they shall not accrue seniority for any time spent working in such capacity for bidding purposes under Article Sixteen (16) hereof.

7. When a nursing vacancy occurs, the Manor will post same in accordance with the Labor Agreement. Prior to permanently filling said nursing vacancy, any senior qualified employee may request to laterally transfer to the floor location of the second vacancy created by virtue of the aforementioned lateral transfer. Senior qualified employees shall be given preference. There shall be no further lateral transfers with respect to the nursing vacancy. Requests for transfers will not be unreasonably denied.

8.
A. Westmoreland Manor shall grant four (4) "EA" (excused absence without pay) days per year to employees working in seven (7) day operations.

B. "EA" days may be used in single or multiple integers or in connection with vacation periods. However, employees who intend to use their "EA" days in connection with a vacation period must notify their Department Head on or before March 1st each year.

C. For those employees who desire to utilize their "EA" days in single or multiple integers which are not in connection with a vacation period must notify their Department Head no earlier than two (2) weeks in advance of their requested time off, but in no event shall such notification be later than one (1) week in advance. Individual "EA" days shall be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis. Requests made on the same day among two (2) or more employees shall be granted on the basis of seniority, if necessary.

D. "EA" days shall not be accumulated from year to year.

E. "EA" days shall be scheduled by the Department Head consistent with the staffing of the department.

F. "EA" days, single vacation days or personal days may not be scheduled for use between December 15th and January 2nd.

G. Once "EA" days are scheduled and approved, they may not be changed except by mutual agreement between the County, employee and Union.

9. LPN's and RN's shall be employed on the salary schedule described in Appendix "A-1". RN's with four (4) or more years of RN experience may be hired at Step one (1) on the salary schedule described in Appendix "A-1".

12-8 shift     1 RN    1 LPN    4 NA (3 at Christmas)

Vacation selection for employees in the Nursing Department shall be by overall bargaining unit seniority. The County shall have the right to pull regular employees and use a temporary employee in their place to provide coverage required by the granting of vacations.

The minimum number of people who can schedule personal holidays in nursing shall be as follows:

8-4 shift      1 licensed
              1 non-licensed

4-12 shift     1 employee

12-8 shift     1 employee
(excludes light duty employee and unit clerks).

11. Employees on Light Duty shall not be counted as part of the Manor's nursing care hours.

12. Any temporary nurse aide who is awarded a regular full time or part time position under this Agreement shall be allocated to step one (1) of the appropriate pay grade.

13. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognized the desire to offer employees at Westmoreland Manor consistent and reasonable schedules including scheduling alternate weekends off, and that the work schedules for employees at Westmoreland Manor must be altered to accommodate this scheduling change. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. agree that the ultimate goal is quality care for the residents of Westmoreland Manor and recognize that staffing directly affects this goal. Therefore, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:

A. Employees at Westmoreland Manor will be scheduled for alternate weekends off. Alternate weekends off will be implemented and maintained according to the following schedule:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>% of Staff on Alternate W/E Schedule</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/02</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/03</td>
    <td>40%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/03</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/04</td>
    <td>70%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/1/04</td>
    <td>90%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/1/05</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

B. If at any point, due to increasing vacancy rates that are expected to last beyond one month, the County reserves the right to schedule employees at every third weekend off. This change in schedule will affect the least senior employees (per classification, per shift) and only the number of employees necessary to affect safe staffing numbers.
C. Non-Nursing employees hired into slots developed to work every weekend will not be scheduled alternate weekends off.

D. Nursing employees hired into "12-hour weekend slots or who volunteer to work every weekend will not be scheduled alternate weekends off.

E. The County reserves the right to create some "2 weekends on/2 weekends off" slots if this improves the weekend staffing problems. Such positions will be bid.

F. Employees scheduled for alternate weekends may be required to make up any scheduled weekend missed. Weekend shifts missed due to bereavement leave, leave of absence or extended illness will not need to be rescheduled.

G. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments scheduling more than alternate weekends off. For those currently receiving these schedules, such schedules will be maintained unless conditions change which require an alternate weekend schedule to provide necessary services. But where the current schedules impede other employees from receiving alternate weekends off, the County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss the fair implementation of alternate weekend scheduling for the affected employees.

H. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments that, due to small staff numbers and the current complement of full time to part time employees, cannot implement alternate weekend scheduling. The County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss how to improve schedules for those affected employees.

1. Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that the successful implementation of scheduling changes will be enhanced by employee participation in the discussion and problem solving for the issues affecting work patterns and how they are impacted by alternate weekend schedules. Therefore, the County and S.E.I.U. will meet to discuss implementation issues and propose ways to meet the needs of the residents of the facility, the economic impact of alternate weekend scheduling and the ultimate goal of offering alternate weekend schedules to all employees. Joint management/union meetings for this purpose shall be scheduled during work time.
APPENDIX "D"

WESTMORELAND COUNTY

HEPATITIS B INOCULATION POLICY

Westmoreland County has decided to provide Hepatitis B inoculations to at risk employees and to follow up the three (3) shot series with a blood test to determine the result. Employees will be given the inoculations free of charge if they complete the series. Those employees who start the series and do not complete it in the recommended time frame will be charged the contracted rate of $36.66 per shot received. This could amount to $73.32 for employees who receive the first two (2) shots and do not follow up with their third (3rd) inoculation.

All shots are scheduled in advance at a location and time that is announced (usually at Westmoreland Manor). If an employee is unable to attend the scheduled inoculation, they must notify their supervisor immediately who will then contact the Human Resources Department. These employees will be instructed to report to Med. Care in Youngwood for their inoculation. Those employees receiving shots at Med Care must do so within two (2) days of the missed scheduled day. Employees receiving their shot at Med Care for whatever reason, will be required to pay for the cost of the office visit and will not be reimbursed for this. Westmoreland County will provide Med Care with the needed serum. Employees with valid and documented medical reasons for not continuing with the series of shots will be exempt from this policy. Employees leaving the employment of Westmoreland County prior to completion of the series will have the cost of the shots received deducted from their final pay.

I ____________________________ have read the above policy and agree to its terms and conditions. By signing this I knowingly give Westmoreland County permission to deduct the above cost from my paycheck in accordance with this policy.
