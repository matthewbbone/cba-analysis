ARTICLE 27
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE

Section 1. Introduction

The parties recognize that G.L. C150E. Section 8 provides a mechanism for arbitration of disputes between the parties to a collective bargaining agreement and further provides that the parties to an agreement may establish an independent grievance procedure culminating in final and binding arbitration. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement to use their best efforts to encourage the informal and prompt settlement of grievances which may arise between the Association or an employee or group of employees and the Employer.

Further, each party hereby waives its right, if any, and the rights if any, of all those whom it represents, to use any other procedure established by law to initiate binding arbitration of grievances. In the event the Association or an employee elects to pursue any matter covered by this Agreement in any other forum, the Employer shall have no obligation to process or to continue to process any grievance or arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Article or Article 26 herein.
