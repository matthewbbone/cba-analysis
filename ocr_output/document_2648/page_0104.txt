MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

The University of Massachusetts and the University Staff Association/Massachusetts Teachers Association are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides for employees covered by the terms and conditions of the Agreement to have their salaries directly transferred electronically. Whereas the Association has expressed concern that not all members would be able to avail themselves of the electronic transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:

1) The University and the Association agree that all employees will have their net salary checks electronically forwarded to an account or accounts selected by the employee.

2) In the extraordinary event that the Association alleges that an employee cannot comply with the agreement relative to transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or there is no ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employees' work site or home, the Association shall petition the University Human Resource Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption.

3) The University Human Resource Division shall review the request for Direct Deposit Special Exemption and will notify the Association of its finding.

4) The parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or the Association relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and, further, that the terms of this Memorandum are not grievable and are not arbitrable.

For the University:                For the Association:
