ARTICLE 20
CLASSIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION

Section 1. Class Specifications

A. The appointing authority shall provide the Association with a copy of the class specification of each title covered by this contract for which such a specification exists.

B. Each Employee in the bargaining unit shall be permitted by the appointing authority to have access to examine his or her class specification.

Section 2. Individual Appeal of Classification

The parties agree that any appeal pertaining to reclassification or reallocation shall continue to be governed by the provisions of Section 49 of Chapter 30 of the Massachusetts General Laws and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure herein. An employee in a "trust funded" position who seeks a reclassification of that position may request an audit of the position on the form attached hereto (Appendix C). The employee shall file said form with the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources and shall forward a copy of same to the Association. The Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources or designee shall conduct a job audit within 90 calendar days of receipt of the request. Within ten working days of completion of the job audit, the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources or designee shall hold a hearing. In the case of a request for an individual reclassification, the hearing officer shall not be in the supervisory chain of the employee seeking the reclassification. The Association may participate in the hearing if the employee so requests. The Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources shall make a final determination within 30 calendar days of the hearing. The decision of the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources may be appealed within 10 calendar days to the Director of Human Resources or designee who shall issue a decision within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. When such reclassification request is granted, the moneys necessary to fund such reclassification shall be budgeted for the following fiscal year and, if funds are available, such reclassification shall be effective at the beginning of the payroll week next following the date of the appeal to the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources. The parties agree that the procedure herein provided shall be the sole procedure for reclassification of "trust funded" positions and the grievance and arbitration procedures of Article 27 shall not apply.
