b) Complete a "Certificate of Eligibility for System wide Tuition Remission" (Available in Human Resource and USA/MTA Offices) and have it signed by his/her department head or Supervisor and by the Personnel Administrator of the University. If the tuition remission is to be used by the employee's spouse or dependent child, the name and relationship of this individual should be indicated on the Certificate. The Certificate should be completed as far in advance of the date of enrollment as possible.

c) Submit the completed Certificate of Eligibility with his/her tuition bill to the college or university at which he/she plans to enroll. The employee (or his/her spouse or dependent children) must remit payment at the same time for costs not covered by tuition remission.
