ARTICLE 24
TUITION REMISSION

A. In addition to Section B below, the Employer agrees to maintain all other tuition benefits which employees covered by this Agreement enjoyed under policies and agreements with the Employer immediately prior to the effective date of this Agreement; these benefits shall not be limited or precluded by the provisions of this Article.

B. Full-time Employees

I. Eligibility
a) All full time professional and classified employees of the University who are paid from the AA Subsidiary Account, and who have completed at least six (6) months of service (or in the case of faculty, one academic semester) as of the date of enrollment, shall be eligible for system wide tuition remission benefits. Employees on paid leave of absence or industrial accident leave remain eligible during the period of any such leave. Employees on unpaid leave shall remain eligible for a maximum of one calendar year. Retired or former employees shall not be eligible; however, the spouse and dependent children of retired, former, or deceased employees may retain eligibility under certain conditions (see c, d, and e below).

b) The spouse and dependent child or children of any eligible employee shall also be eligible for system wide tuition remission benefits. A "dependent child" shall mean any natural, adopted or stepchild who is claimed as a dependent on the eligible employee's Federal Tax Return for the tax year immediately preceding enrollment.

No employee's child beyond the age of twenty-five (25) shall be eligible for tuition remission; however, that in exceptional circumstances and for good reason the President or Chancellor of the public college or University may waive this age limitation for an employee's child who continues to meet the IRS standards of dependency.

c) If an eligible employee retires while a child or spouse is enrolled in a program of study or degree program, the spouse or child may complete such program with tuition remission, provided that enrollment is continuous.

d) If an eligible employee who has completed at least five (5) years of full time equivalent service dies, the surviving spouse and children shall be eligible to enter and/or complete one full program of study or degree program with tuition remission. The term "program" as used in this Section d and the above Section c shall include, but not be limited to, any program of study begun at a Community College and continued without interruption through the bachelor's degree at a State College or University.

e) If an eligible employee leaves the employment of the University under conditions other than those described in c and d above while a spouse or child is enrolled in a course/program, the spouse or child may complete the semester already begun. At the end of the semester his/her eligibility for tuition remission terminates.
