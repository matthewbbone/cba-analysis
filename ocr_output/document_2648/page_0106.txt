SIDE LETTER 2
ADMINISTRATIVE COMPUTING AND PAYROLL SYSTEMS

The parties acknowledge that the University will be implementing new administrative computing and payroll systems. To ensure that the changes required by these systems are introduced and implemented in the most effective manner, the Union agrees to accept the University's implementation and changes to business practices, procedures, and functions as are necessary to achieve such implementation (e.g. the change from a weekly to biweekly payroll system). The University and the Union will establish a Special Labor-Management Committee made up of an equal number of Union representatives and Management representatives. This committee shall be the sole forum for the parties to discuss any issues of impact to the bargaining unit arising from the implementation of the systems. The parties will reopen negotiations subject prior to implementing any change which has the effect of reducing a unit member's pay in any fiscal year.
