that individual’s seniority does not exceed that of the employee scheduled to be laid off.

a) An employee scheduled to be laid off from a clerical unit position shall first seek to bump one of the three least senior individuals in his/her current classification. If there is no position available or if the bump is denied, he/she may next seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal requirements of the employee’s present position.

b) An employee scheduled to be laid off from a technical or administrative unit position may initially choose to bump one of the three least senior individuals who is either in his/her current classification, in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus or who is in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal duties of the employee’s present position. If a position in the selected category is not available or the bump is denied, he/she may then choose to bump one of the three least senior employees in his/her choice of the two remaining categories. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump the least senior employee from the remaining category.

c) For purposes of this Article, the regular duties of a position are those listed on the Form 30 for that position provided the duties described on the Form 30 do not exceed the level, tenor and complexity of the state specification. The University shall provide Form 30’s when the Association makes a specific request for good reason.

G. In the event an employee is scheduled to be laid off, or is on layoff status as set forth in Article 23 (D) and there exists a vacant position in the bargaining unit which has been certified for filling in an equal or lower-graded classification, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such an employee to fill such position, provided the employee can perform the work. Any employee in such category shall have their name forwarded for any vacant position prior to Article 17 being applicable.

H. Employees to be laid off will be notified of such layoff in writing, as soon as practicable, but in no event less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the layoff. The Association will be sent a list, from the appointing authority, of the employees being laid off at the same time as the written notices are given to the employees. The University will provide, within five (5) calendar days, the Form 30’s and other information necessary for an employee scheduled to be laid off to make an informed decision on bumping options.

I. In the event of layoff, the Division of Human Resources shall make every reasonable effort to obtain preferential treatment during the layoff period for the affected employee(s) in enrolling in training courses offered by the University.
