ARTICLE 17D
ANNOUNCING VACANCIES

The appointing authority agrees that each department head shall promptly be sent a copy of the "Yellow Sheet", and be encouraged to post it conspicuously. Also, twenty-five (25) copies will be sent to the Association. The "Yellow Sheet" shall be posted and remain on notice boards for six (6) days before the application closing date. All vacancies shown on the "Yellow Sheet" must show the vacancy number, classification, department, pay grade, shift, application closing date, earliest date of appointment, source or funding and, for temporary appointments, the ending date. All vacancies filled shall receive identical listing on the "Yellow Sheet" giving date of appointment and must indicate whether the person selected to fill the position is a University employee or otherwise. Positions filled as a result of reallocation appeals shall not be advertised on the "Yellow Sheet". The name and new title of persons receiving such reallocations shall be listed on the back of the "Yellow Sheet" and identified by a double asterisk.

A special labor-management committee shall be formed to explore the feasibility of advertising, on the "Yellow Sheet," vacancies that occur in Association positions in UMass Extension. The committee shall be comprised of two representatives designated by the Employer and two representatives designated by the Association. Said committee shall meet within thirty (30) days of the signing of the Agreement.
