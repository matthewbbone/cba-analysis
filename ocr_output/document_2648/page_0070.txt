Section 14.

Where toxic or radioactive materials are in use and known to the appointing authority to be injurious to employees, such areas shall be identified and posted.

Section 15.

Areas found to contain friable asbestos-containing materials shall be posted, and all reports of suspected areas of asbestos hazard shall be promptly investigated.

Section 16.

The appointing authority will give the highest priority to employees' health and safety in the purchase, maintenance and use of Video Display Terminals (VDTs). Upon written request of the Association, the appointing authority will make available to the Association the published safety and health specifications which have been provided by the manufacturer or lessor for VDTs purchased or leased subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. The appointing authority will make appropriate corrections for any reported VDT focus and clarity of image problem(s). VDT operators shall not be required to perform continuous duties at the work screen for periods in excess of two (2) hours at a time. For each consecutive two (2) hour period worked at his/her station, the employee shall be entitled to be away from the screen for a contiguous period of fifteen (15) minutes. Such fifteen (15) minute period may consist of an alternative job assignment or any break or lunch period otherwise authorized by this Agreement. Pregnant employees who work on VDT systems may request temporary re-assignment within their job description or a comparable position, and be re-assigned within two weeks of notification for the duration of the pregnancy. Such work assignment shall be determined by the Appointing Authority or its designee. This request must be in writing to the Appointing Authority with verification from the employee's physician.

Section 17.

Where credible evidence exists (as determined by the appropriate state agency or department) of a communicable disease (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis B, etc.), the employer shall forthwith make every reasonable effort to provide all employees coming into contact with the afflicted person(s) and/or environment, with appropriate training and advice. Management will take necessary prevention action in accordance with existing medical practice when a person is suspected to have a communicable transmittable disease.

Section 18.

If an employee believes that he or she is working in an unusually hot or cold location, the employee may request that the supervisor or the department head investigate the matter. If the condition cannot be corrected within a reasonable period, the supervisor/department head shall reassign bargaining unit members to another area until the condition is corrected. If no suitable alternative space is available, and the condition cannot be corrected within a reasonable period of time as determined by the supervisor/department head after consultation with the designee of the Vice Chancellor of Administration and Finance, employees will be released from work without loss of pay or benefits until the condition is corrected or suitable work space is made available.
