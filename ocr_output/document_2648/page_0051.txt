ARTICLE 17B
PERMANENT, INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS

A. No employee who is employed on the central campus of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst shall be involuntarily transferred, on a permanent basis, to a work site that is more than fifteen (15) miles from Amherst.

B. No employee who is employed at a work site away from the central campus of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst shall be involuntarily transferred, on a permanent basis, to a work site that is more than fifteen (15) miles from his/her current work site, unless the employee’s entire office is relocated.

C. When a permanent, involuntary transfer results in changing an employee’s permanent work site, the employee shall be given ten (10) working days advance, written notice of such transfer. If the transfer is made because of a change in work load, assignments shall be filled by qualified volunteers in order of seniority. If there are no volunteers, assignments shall be made in inverse order of seniority. Such transfers shall not be made in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
