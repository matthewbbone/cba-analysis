ARTICLE 11
VACATIONS

Section 1.

A. Beginning at the end of the first full payroll month (hereinafter in this Article "month") of employment, vacation leave with pay shall be credited to full-time employees at the end of each full month of employment, as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Length of continuous full-time “creditable service” as of the end of each applicable month</th>
    <th>Vacation Leave Accrued</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than fifty-four (54) months. (4 \( \frac{1}{2} \) years)</td>
    <td>5/6 day per month (total of 10 days per year)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fifty-four (54) months, but less than one hundred fourteen (114) months. (4 \( \frac{1}{2} \) to 9 \( \frac{1}{2} \) years)</td>
    <td>1 \( \frac{1}{3} \) days per month (total of 15 days per year)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One hundred fourteen (114) months, but less than two hundred thirty-four (234) months. (9 \( \frac{1}{2} \) to 19 \( \frac{1}{2} \) years)</td>
    <td>1 2/3 days per month (total of 20 days per year)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Two hundred thirty-four (234) months or more. (19 \( \frac{1}{2} \) years)</td>
    <td>2 1/12 days per month (total of 25 days per year)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

B. For determining vacation status under this Article, "creditable service" only shall be used. All service beginning on the first working day of the first full month in the institution where rendered, and all service thereafter becomes "creditable service" provided there has not been any break of three (3) years or more in such service as referred to in Section 11 of this Article. In computing an employee's vacation status, all "creditable service" from the first working day in the Institution up to the end of each full month of service rendered shall constitute the "creditable service" which shall be used to establish vacation credit for such month. Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, an employee shall, on the effective date of this Agreement, be deemed to have that "creditable service," if any, which he/she had at the termination of the predecessor Agreement.

Section 2.

A regular part-time employee shall be granted vacation leave in the same proportion that his/her part-time service bears to full-time service.

Section 3.

Vacation leave accrued during any month shall be credited on the last day of the month based on the employee's full-time equivalent status on that date and shall be available for use the following day.
