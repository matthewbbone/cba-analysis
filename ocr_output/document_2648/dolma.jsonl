For the purposes of this Agreement, the Unit shall be understood to consist of:\n\nAll full-time and regular part-time administrative, clerical and technical employees of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst; excluding regular part-time employees who are expected to work less than 50 percent (50%) of the hours in a work year of a full-time employee in the same title; managerial and confidential employees within the meaning of M.G.L. Chapter 150E; students; employees paid on an hourly basis; supervisory employees and all other employees.\n\nShould any new classified classification(s) be added to the work force, the appointing authority shall notify the Association of such new classified classification(s). The appointing authority shall determine if such new classified classification(s) shall be added to the bargaining unit and the appointing authority shall notify the Association of its determination. If the Association disagrees with the appointing authority's determination, the matter may be referred to the State Labor Relations Commission by the Association with a request that the Commission make a determination. In the event it shall be finally adjudicated that the classified classification(s) be added to the bargaining unit, the classified classification(s) shall then be subject to the provisions of this Agreement.\n\nShould the appointing authority determine that a position or positions in a classification included in the Unit at the time of the execution of the April 28, 1981 Memorandum of Understanding concerning the exclusion of confidential/managerial employees as most recently amended by the parties, is no longer appropriately included in the Unit, it shall notify the Association of such determination. In the event the Association does not agree to the exclusion(s), the matter shall be referred to the State Labor Relations Commission for determination.

Said moneys shall either be returned to the employee or tendered to the Association, depending upon the outcome of the parties' discussions or the determination of the Labor Relations Commission.\n\nThe appointing authority agrees that when an employee in the bargaining unit is promoted, transferred, successfully applies for or otherwise moves from his/her unit position to a position excluded from the bargaining Unit by virtue of the April 28, 1981 Memorandum of Understanding, as most recently amended by the parties, the appointing authority shall so advise the Association.\n\nThe Employer will not aid, promote or finance any labor group or organization which purports to engage in collective bargaining, or make any agreement with any such group or individual for the purpose of undermining the Association or changing any condition in this Agreement. The Employer agrees to apply applicable provisions of this Agreement to those employees who receive all contractual benefits, whose funding source is derived from institute, grant or contract funds, and who perform the function of those positions covered by\nthis Agreement to the extent that the terms of their respective institute, grant or contract funding source and the level of funding thereunder so allow, as determined by the CEO.\nARTICLE 2\nSCOPE OF AGREEMENT\n\nThe parties agree that this Agreement in all respects supplants all particular provisions of the following General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Rules and Regulations thereto and any future rules and regulations promulgated thereunder namely: the Second Paragraph of Section Twenty-Eight of Chapter Seven (Red Book); Section Twenty-Four A; Paragraphs (4) and (5) (Gray Book), formerly Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Section Forty-Five; Paragraphs (1), (4), and (10) of Section Forty-Six, and Section Fifty-Three of Chapter Thirty; Sections Thirty to Forty-Two, inclusive, of Chapter One Hundred and Forty-Nine.\n\nIt is acknowledged during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, the Association had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to all proper subjects of collective bargaining. Therefore, for the life of this Agreement, this Agreement shall constitute the total Agreement between the parties; and the Association agrees that the Employer shall not be obligated to any additional collective bargaining.\n\nNo addition to, alteration, modification, practice, or waiver of any term, provision, covenant, or condition or restriction in this Agreement shall be valid, binding, or of any force or effect unless made in writing and executed by the Employer and the Association.\n\nAny prior agreements covering employees covered by this Agreement shall be terminated and of no effect, upon the effective date of this Agreement and shall be superseded by this Agreement.\nARTICLE 3\nMANAGEMENT RIGHTS\n\nAll management rights and functions, except those which are clearly and expressly abridged by this Agreement, shall remain vested exclusively in the Employer. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to impair or limit the powers and duties of the Employer under the laws of the Commonwealth. The Association recognizes the right of the Employer and any of its duly authorized agents to control, operate and manage the University and its facilities without interference; to subcontract work; to determine operational policies, methods, and procedures; to direct, hire, promote, transfer, upgrade, allocate, reallocate, classify and reclassify employees; to discharge, suspend, demote, or otherwise discipline employees for just cause; to lay-off employees for lack of work, lack of funds or curtailment of programs, and to recall employees; to promulgate and enforce all reasonable rules relating to operations, safety measures, and other matters; to promulgate and enforce rules and regulations; provided, however, that in exercising the foregoing rights of management, the Employer agrees that it will not violate the specific provisions of this Agreement.\n\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Employer reserves the right, subject only to the express provisions of this Agreement, to manage the University, to require reasonable standards of performance and to maintain order and efficiency.\nARTICLE 4\nASSOCIATION SECURITY\nDues Checkoff\n\nSection 1.\n\nThe Association shall have the exclusive right to the checkoff and transmittal of Association dues or agency service fee on behalf of each employee.\n\nSection 2.\n\nAn employee may consent in writing to the authorization of the deduction of Association dues from his/her wages and to the designation of the Association as the recipient thereof. Such consent shall be in a form acceptable to the appointing authority and shall bear the signature of the employee. An employee may withdraw his/her Association dues checkoff authorization by giving at least sixty (60) days notice in writing to the Association. The Association will then notify the appointing authority upon receipt of written notice from an individual employee to terminate his/her dues checkoff within twenty (20) working days of receipt of such notification. The foregoing notwithstanding, deduction of dues will automatically and immediately cease for an employee upon his or her departure from the bargaining unit. In the event that the employee is transferring to a non-bargaining unit University position, individual notification of such cessation shall be made to the Association and the employee. The Association hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the appointing authority harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from the failure of the Association to transmit the dues deduction authorization by an employee as stated above.\n\nSection 3.\n\nAn employee may consent in writing to the authorization of the deduction of an agency service fee from his/her wages and to the designation of the Association as the recipient thereof. Such consent shall be in a form acceptable to the appointing authority and shall bear the signature of the employee. An employee may withdraw his/her agency service fee authorization by giving at least sixty (60) days notice in writing to the Association. The Association will then notify the appointing authority upon receipt of written notice from an individual employee to terminate his/her agency service fee authorization within twenty (20) working days of receipt of such notification. The foregoing notwithstanding, deduction of an agency service fee will automatically and immediately cease for an employee upon his or her departure from the bargaining unit. In the event that the employee is transferring to a non-bargaining unit University position, individual notification of such cessation shall be made to the Association and the employee. The Association hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the appointing authority harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from the failure of the Association to transmit the agency service fee deduction authorization by an employee as stated above.\n\nSection 4.\n\nIn the event of administrative error or other concerns involving the authorized deduction of Association dues or agency service fee from employees' wages, the parties shall expeditiously meet to attempt to correct the error or address the difficulties. This provision is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained herein.\nSection 5.\n\nThe appointing authority shall deduct dues or an agency fee from the pay of employees who request such deduction in accordance with this Article and transmit such funds monthly in accordance with departmental policy as of July 1, 1977 to the Association Treasurer together with a list of employees whose dues or agency fees are transmitted and the amounts thereof. The appointing authority may require that the Treasurer of the Association has given to the Association a bond in a form approved by the appointing authority for the faithful performance of his/her duties, in a sum and with such surety or securities as are satisfactory to the appointing authority.\nARTICLE 5\nAGENCY SERVICE FEE\n\nSection 1.\n\nEach employee who elects not to join or maintain membership in the Association shall be required to pay as a condition of employment, beginning thirty (30) days following the commencement of employment, an agency service fee to the Association in an amount that is equal to the amount required to become and remain a member in good standing.\n\nSection 2.\n\nThis Article shall not become operative until this Agreement has been formally executed, pursuant to a vote of a majority of all employees in that bargaining unit present and voting.\n\nSection 3.\n\nThe Association shall reimburse the appointing authority for any expenses incurred as a result of being ordered to reinstate an employee terminated at the request of the Association for not paying the agency service fee. The Association will intervene in and defend any administrative or court litigation concerning the propriety of such termination for failure to pay the agency service fee. In such litigation, the appointing authority shall have no obligation to defend the termination.\n\nSection 4.\n\nDisputes between the parties concerning this Article shall be resolved in accordance with the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. In the event such a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to order the appointing authority to pay such agency fee on behalf of any employee. If the arbitrator decides that an employee has failed to pay or authorize the payment of the agency service fee in accordance with this Article, the only remedy shall be the termination of the employment of such employee if the employee continues to refuse to pay or authorize payment of the required agency service fee after having sufficient time to do so.\n\nSection 5.\n\nIt is specifically agreed that the appointing authority assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article and the preceding Association Security Article, and the Association hereby agrees it will indemnify and hold the appointing authority harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from the termination of an employee hereunder or from deductions made by the appointing authority.\nARTICLE 6\nASSOCIATION BUSINESS\n\nSection 1.

Therefore the parties acknowledge the need for positive and aggressive affirmative action. To accomplish these goals certain positions may be designated as affirmative action target positions in accordance with the Employer's Affirmative Action Plan filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. The President of the Association shall be informed of such targeted positions simultaneously with the Division of Human Resources.\n\nSection 3.\n\nNo employee shall participate directly in any decision or recommendation relating to appointment, promotion, retention, or other condition of employment at the University of any parent, child, spouse, sibling, parent-in-law, sibling-in-law, child-in-law, or stepchild of such employee, or supervise the performance of any such person except under such circumstances as the CEO may determine as warranting waiver of this prohibition in the best interests of the University.\n\nSection 4.\n\nThe Employer and the Association acknowledge that sexual harassment is a form of unlawful sex discrimination, and the parties mutually agree that no unit employee should be subjected to such harassment. The term sexual harassment as used here is conduct such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which constitutes sexual harassment when:\n\nA. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;\n\nB. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or\nC. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\nSection 5.\n\nAny charges of discrimination in violation of this Article shall be subject to the Campus Affirmative Action Grievance Procedure, and applicable State and Federal Laws under which the Association may represent the employee. Such charges shall not be subject to the contractual grievance and arbitration procedures.\nARTICLE 8\nWORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES\n\nSection 1. Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday\n\nA. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for full-time employees shall be thirty-seven and one-half (37 1/2) hours per week excluding meal periods.\n\nB. The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and Association stewards.\n\nC. When the appointing authority desires to change the work schedule and/or work week of an employee, a discussion shall be held with the affected employee prior to the issuance of a written notice. Such written notice shall be given to the affected employee at least ten (10) working days in advance of the date of such contemplated change. If requested by the affected employee, written reasons for the change shall be provided within seven (7) calendar days of the request. Any such request must be made prior to the effective date of the schedule change. In no event shall such request for written reasons operate to forestall the effective date of the schedule change. In cases of emergency involving the protection of the property of the appointing authority or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the appointing authority, such discussion and/or written notice shall not be required unless such emergency continues to exist for more than five (5) working days. After that time, written reasons for the change in the work schedule and/or work week will be provided to the affected employee in the most practicable manner.\n\nD. To the extent practicable, the normal workweek shall consist of five (5) consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable, employees in continuous operations shall receive two (2) consecutive days off in each seven-day period. This subsection would not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours program.\n\nSubject to the needs of the department, the department head may offer to employees the opportunity to schedule working hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., provided that the total number of each employee\u2019s working hours per day remain unchanged. However, all major departmental offices must remain open between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Upon request of a bargaining unit member, the supervisor may grant, for a specific period of time, a flexible personal work schedule, so long as the bargaining unit member can demonstrate that the proposed schedule will not interfere with or detract from the delivery of services provided or the day to day operation of the department. Request for a flexible work schedule shall not be unreasonably denied.\nSection 2. Overtime\n\nA. An employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of forty hours per week.\n\nB. An employee shall be compensated at his/her regular rate for authorized overtime work performed up to forty hours per week that is in excess of his/her regular workweek.\n\nC. An employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of eight hours in his/her regular workday except that an employee whose regular workday is more than eight hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of his/her regular workday. The appointing authority shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, curtail the scheduled hours of an employee during the remainder of a workweek in which the employee has previously worked hours beyond his/her normally scheduled workday. This paragraph shall not apply to employees, who, because of the nature of the duties of their positions, work an irregular workday, nor shall it apply to employees who have been permitted by the appointing authority to participate in an approved voluntary flexible hours program, that has been duly authorized by the appointing authority and by the Personnel Administrator.\n\nD. Compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation may be authorized by the CEO or designee only upon request of the employee. Compensatory time off shall be computed at the same rate as overtime compensation. It must be taken within one hundred and eighty (180) days of when it was earned, unless agreed otherwise by the CEO or designee, and the employee, to be taken at a time designated by the employee and approved by the CEO or designee. An employee may not accrue more than two hundred and forty (240) hours of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. Employees who have accrued the maximum amount shall be paid the hourly rate authorized for overtime work. Upon termination or prior to termination, an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the employee's final regular rate of pay.\n\nE. With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on paid leave status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation. If sick leave is taken in a week of mandatory overtime, an employee may substitute three (3) days per year of alternate time (vacation, holiday, compensatory, or personal) time and up to two (2) days per year of sick time (with medical evidence provided).

For determining vacation status under this Article, \"creditable service\" only shall be used. All service beginning on the first working day of the first full month in the institution where rendered, and all service thereafter becomes \"creditable service\" provided there has not been any break of three (3) years or more in such service as referred to in Section 11 of this Article. In computing an employee's vacation status, all \"creditable service\" from the first working day in the Institution up to the end of each full month of service rendered shall constitute the \"creditable service\" which shall be used to establish vacation credit for such month.

In the event an employee is denied a step rate increase by his/her CEO, he/she shall be given a written statement of reasons therefore not later than five (5) days preceding the date when the increase would otherwise have taken effect. Time off the payroll is not creditable service for the purpose of step rate increases.\n\nB. Effective July 5, 1998, whenever an employee receives a promotion, as defined in Article 17, except an employee who has accepted a demotion as the result of a layoff, the employee\u2019s new salary rate shall be calculated as follows:\n\n1.

The appointing authority is recognized as the sole authority to appoint an applicant to a vacant position. When the appointing authority determines that a vacancy is to be filled, it will be published in the \"Yellow Sheet\" as outlined in Article 17D. Appointments shall be published within ten (10) calendar days following the appearance of the appointee's name on the payroll register and in accordance with the further provisions of Article 17D. The appointing authority will not be obligated to consider an application for a position from an employee who has not submitted his/her request, nor registered under the current blanket policy of the appointing authority, on or before the seventh (7th) calendar day after the vacancy is posted.\n\nB. For the purpose of this Article, promotion shall be defined as an appointment to a position of a higher job grade; a change in job title without a change in job grade shall be considered a lateral appointment.\n\nSection 2.\n\nAll applications for a vacant position shall be divided into priority subgroups a, b, c, and d respectively. The University Employment Office shall send at one time all groups of applicants for a vacant position to the appointing authority. Only after the review, which will include interviews where appropriate, of each group has been completed and no sufficiently qualified candidate has been selected, may the appointing authority look at and review the applications of the next group. The appointing authority shall hold the applications and shall consider each group in the following order of priority:\n\nSubgroup a\u2013 The applications of bargaining unit employees and other applicants within the targeted pool as defined by the appointing authority\u2019s affirmative action program, only if the position has been targeted by the appointing authority\u2019s affirmative action program.\n\nSubgroup b \u2013 The applications of non-probationary employees within the bargaining unit.\n\nSubgroup c \u2013 The applications of probationary unit members.\n\nSubgroup d \u2013 The applications of non-bargaining unit persons.\n\nIn making selections from within a priority sub-group, campus seniority will govern where upon review by the appointing authority ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. Any determinations made by the appointing authority concerning the filling of vacancies from among bargaining unit applicants in subgroups a, b, and c shall be grievable to Step 4, but shall not be arbitratable. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of another bargaining unit employee then the reason for bypassing the bargaining unit employee\u2019s seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only bargaining unit members in subgroup a may grieve appointments to targeted positions.\nSection 3\n\nIn filling vacancies campus seniority will govern where, upon review by the appointing authority, the ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a non-bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of a bargaining unit applicant then the reasons for bypassing the bargaining unit employee's seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only a senior bargaining unit member who has been bypassed shall have the right to request such information. Under these circumstances, the appointing authority's determination may be grieved and processed through arbitration. In the event arbitration is invoked hereunder, the arbitrator's authority shall be limited to reviewing, consistent with the criteria set forth herein, the appointing authority's determination that the qualifications of the successful and unsuccessful candidates are not equal. In no event shall an arbitrator have authority to review or reverse the appointing authority's determination under Section 2 hereof that applicants within a particular priority subgroup are not sufficiently qualified. A unit member may grieve his/her non-selection for a position only to Step 4 of the grievance process if such position was awarded to another unit member.\n\nSection 4.\n\nThe Employer shall use reasonable efforts to answer requests for information regarding the search and selection procedure submitted by the senior unit member who has been bypassed and makes such request pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 and requests made in the investigation of a grievance filed under Section 2 or Section 3.\n\nSection 5. Trial Period\n\nA. An employee who is appointed to a different position shall serve a three (3) month trial period from the effective date of the appointment. In no case, however, shall this trial period expire prior to the completion of six (6) months of continuous employment from the most recent date of hire.\n\nB. During this trial period, if the employee's work performance in the new assignment is not satisfactory to the CEO said employee shall revert back to his or her former position. This matter may be a proper subject for the Grievance procedure.\n\nC. If the employee is not satisfied with the new position, he/she may elect to return to the former position within thirty (30) days after said new appointment.\n\nD. All appointments made related to this section shall be temporary or provisional appointments at least until the completion of the trial period. All vacancies resulting from an employee's appointment pursuant to this section shall be filled temporarily or provisionally at least until the appointed employee has completed his/her trial period. The employer shall notify all employees of this provisional appointment trial period.\n\nSection 6.\n\nAt the time of appointment to a higher grade, an employee will receive an increment consistent with the Employee Compensation Article of this Agreement.\nSection 7.\n\nA bargaining unit vacancy may not be filled with a CC/03 employee unless it is to meet one of the following conditions:\n\na) Temporarily replace a bargaining unit member who is on approved leave of absence.\n\nb) To fill a position which is known to be of limited duration or a duration of less than twelve (12) months.\n\nc) To deal with an emergency situation.\n\nSection 8.\n\nA. The University may advertise and fill new bargaining unit positions as temporary appointments. A temporary appointment shall not exceed two (2) years but may be extended one (1) year upon written notice to the Association. When the University seeks to fill a temporary position it shall identify the position as temporary on the Yellow Sheet.\n\nB. A temporary employee who has completed their term of appointment before three (3) years have elapsed may be separated from the University without recourse to Articles 22, except as provided herein, and Article 26. Laid off temporary employees shall be considered \"off campus\" applicants when they apply for a position they held as a temporary appointment that becomes permanent. For all other positions they shall be considered \"on campus\" applicants for two (2) years from their date of layoff.\nARTICLE 17A\nSENIORITY - PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES\n\nSection 1.\n\nNew employees hired in this unit shall be considered as probationary employees for the first six (6) months of their continuous employment. When an employee finishes the probationary period, he/she shall be entered on the seniority list of the unit and shall rank for seniority from the six (6) months prior to the date he/she completed the probationary period. There shall be no seniority among probationary employees.\n\nSection 2.\n\nThe Association shall represent probationary employees for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to tours of duty and other conditions of employment.\n\nSection 3.\n\nDuring the probationary period, an employee may be disciplined or terminated without recourse to the grievance and arbitration procedure provided herein, except discipline or discharge for lawful and protected Association activity or as indicated pursuant to Article 29.\nARTICLE 17B\nPERMANENT, INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS\n\nA.

No employee who is employed at a work site away from the central campus of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst shall be involuntarily transferred, on a permanent basis, to a work site that is more than fifteen (15) miles from his/her current work site, unless the employee\u2019s entire office is relocated.\n\nC. When a permanent, involuntary transfer results in changing an employee\u2019s permanent work site, the employee shall be given ten (10) working days advance, written notice of such transfer. If the transfer is made because of a change in work load, assignments shall be filled by qualified volunteers in order of seniority. If there are no volunteers, assignments shall be made in inverse order of seniority. Such transfers shall not be made in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\nARTICLE 17C\nTEMPORARY TRANSFERS\n\nConsistent with the needs of the appointing authority, voluntary, temporary transfers shall be offered on a seniority basis and rotated among employees within the department whenever practicable. Assigned transfers will be allocated by inverse seniority, consistent with the requirements of the appointing authority, and rotated among employees of the department whenever practicable. Such transfers shall not be made in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\nARTICLE 17D\nANNOUNCING VACANCIES\n\nThe appointing authority agrees that each department head shall promptly be sent a copy of the \"Yellow Sheet\", and be encouraged to post it conspicuously. Also, twenty-five (25) copies will be sent to the Association. The \"Yellow Sheet\" shall be posted and remain on notice boards for six (6) days before the application closing date. All vacancies shown on the \"Yellow Sheet\" must show the vacancy number, classification, department, pay grade, shift, application closing date, earliest date of appointment, source or funding and, for temporary appointments, the ending date. All vacancies filled shall receive identical listing on the \"Yellow Sheet\" giving date of appointment and must indicate whether the person selected to fill the position is a University employee or otherwise. Positions filled as a result of reallocation appeals shall not be advertised on the \"Yellow Sheet\". The name and new title of persons receiving such reallocations shall be listed on the back of the \"Yellow Sheet\" and identified by a double asterisk.\n\nA special labor-management committee shall be formed to explore the feasibility of advertising, on the \"Yellow Sheet,\" vacancies that occur in Association positions in UMass Extension. The committee shall be comprised of two representatives designated by the Employer and two representatives designated by the Association. Said committee shall meet within thirty (30) days of the signing of the Agreement.\nARTICLE 17E\nWORK AREA, SHIFT PREFERENCE\n\nThe appointing authority may change an employee's workweek schedule, shift, and location as deemed necessary by the appointing authority. Unless the need for changing an employee's workweek schedule, shift or location is of an emergency nature, the appointing authority shall give the employee a seven (7) working day written notice of such change. Whenever an employee requests a change of workweek schedule or shift, approval of such request shall not be unreasonably withheld if a vacancy exists in the classification on a workweek schedule or shift other than that which he/she is then working, provided the employee has sufficient classification seniority and, in the judgment of the appointing authority, is able to adequately perform the duties of the vacancy.\nARTICLE 18\nCONTRACTING OUT\n\nWhen the contracting out of work which will result in the layoff of employees, who perform the function that will be contracted out, is contemplated, but prior to its implementation, a Special Labor Management Committee will be established to advise the CEO on the contracting out of personnel services. The Committee shall consist of four persons, two designated by the Association and two designated by the Director of Human Resources. Said Committee shall examine cost effectiveness, quality of work, impact on career development, availability of positions within the University for which any laid-off employee may be qualified and the availability of applicable training programs and make appropriate recommendations to the CEO.\n\nWhen the decision to implement the contracting out is finalized, the appointing authority will notify the Association and discuss the decision and the availability of positions within the University for which the laid-off employee is determined to be qualified and the availability of any training programs which may be applicable to the employee. In reviewing these placement possibilities, every effort will be made to seek matches of worker skills and qualifications with available, comparable positions.\nARTICLE 19\nOUT OF TITLE WORK\n\nSection 1. Work in a Lower Classification\n\nA. When an employee is assigned by the appointing authority or designee to perform the duties of a position classified in a grade lower than that in which the employee performs his/her duties, he/she will be compensated at his/her regular rate of pay as if performing his/her regular duties.\n\nB. An employee who is assigned by the appointing authority or designee to perform overtime work in a lower classification shall have overtime compensation computed at the employee's regular rate of compensation.\n\nSection 2. Work in a Higher Classification\n\nA. Any employee who, with the full knowledge and concurrence of the appointing authority or designee and due to a position being vacant, performs the duties of a position classified in a higher grade or of a position of higher rank for a period of one day or more up to fifteen consecutive work days shall receive, in addition to his or her regular salary, six dollars ($6.00) per day. If after fifteen consecutive work days the employee continues to perform the duties of a position classified in a higher grade or of a position of higher rank said employee shall receive appropriate compensation, in accordance with Article 14, from the sixteenth day forward while in the higher grade. However, if it is known from the first day that said assignment is to be for more than fifteen (15) consecutive work days said employee shall receive appropriate compensation, in accordance with Article 14, from the first day such duties are performed. This section only applies to the reassignment of duties necessitated by an unfilled higher position or by the absence of the incumbent of a higher position due to sick leave or leave without pay. This section does not apply to the assignment of an employee to perform the duties of a higher position when the incumbent of the higher position is on any paid leave other than sick leave, however, if there is a change in the paid leave status of the incumbent during the duration of his or her sick leave, the employee shall continue to receive the additional compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\nWhenever any employee is performing the duties of a higher position in accordance with the conditions stated above, he/she shall no sooner than the fifth consecutive working day of their performance and no later than the tenth consecutive working day, complete and transmit to his/her supervisor the form attached (Appendix B). The supervisor shall thereupon complete the applicable portion of the form and forward it to the department head, or designee, who shall sign the form and transmit the same to the Personnel Administrator or designee, who shall thereupon determine whether the work is or is not out of title work. This determination as well as the appropriate position classification to be assigned to an employee under the provisions of this section shall be determined by a job audit to be performed by the Personnel Administrator or designee and shall be final and binding on all parties.\n\nAn employee who is assigned by the appointing authority to perform overtime work in a higher classification shall have overtime compensation computed at the first step rate of the higher classification, unless the employee's regular rate of compensation\nis higher, in which case the overtime compensation shall be computed at the employee's regular rate of compensation.\nARTICLE 20\nCLASSIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION\n\nSection 1. Class Specifications\n\nA. The appointing authority shall provide the Association with a copy of the class specification of each title covered by this contract for which such a specification exists.\n\nB. Each Employee in the bargaining unit shall be permitted by the appointing authority to have access to examine his or her class specification.\n\nSection 2. Individual Appeal of Classification\n\nThe parties agree that any appeal pertaining to reclassification or reallocation shall continue to be governed by the provisions of Section 49 of Chapter 30 of the Massachusetts General Laws and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure herein. An employee in a \"trust funded\" position who seeks a reclassification of that position may request an audit of the position on the form attached hereto (Appendix C). The employee shall file said form with the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources and shall forward a copy of same to the Association. The Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources or designee shall conduct a job audit within 90 calendar days of receipt of the request. Within ten working days of completion of the job audit, the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources or designee shall hold a hearing. In the case of a request for an individual reclassification, the hearing officer shall not be in the supervisory chain of the employee seeking the reclassification. The Association may participate in the hearing if the employee so requests. The Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources shall make a final determination within 30 calendar days of the hearing. The decision of the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources may be appealed within 10 calendar days to the Director of Human Resources or designee who shall issue a decision within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. When such reclassification request is granted, the moneys necessary to fund such reclassification shall be budgeted for the following fiscal year and, if funds are available, such reclassification shall be effective at the beginning of the payroll week next following the date of the appeal to the Personnel Administrator/Associate Director of Human Resources. The parties agree that the procedure herein provided shall be the sole procedure for reclassification of \"trust funded\" positions and the grievance and arbitration procedures of Article 27 shall not apply.\nARTICLE 21\nCLASS REALLOCATIONS\n\nSection 1.\n\nClass reallocations may be requested by the Association whenever it believes a reallocation is justified by the existence of an inequitable relationship between the positions covered by the reallocation requests and other positions covered by this Agreement. If the appointing authority agrees that such an inequity exists, the appointing authority and the Association agree to jointly petition the General Court for such class reallocation. If all incumbents of a position covered by this Agreement, for which such reallocation is sought, are paid from other than State-appropriated monies, the appointing authority agrees that money to fund the reallocation shall be budgeted for the following fiscal year by the University. If, however, the parties are unable to reach agreement, the matter shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\n\nSection 2.\n\nThe appointing authority and the Association agree that the procedure provided in Section 1 shall be the sole procedure for class reallocation for all classes covered by this Agreement and no other class reallocations shall be granted.\nARTICLE 22\nLAYOFF AND RECALL\n\nSection 1. Definition of Layoff\n\nA. Layoff shall be defined as the reduction of the work force due to lack of work, lack of funds, or curtailment of programs and shall not mean a termination. The appointing authority agrees that no unit employee will be laid off in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Employees hired with a minimum commitment of thirty-five (35) weeks per year shall be laid off in accordance with their employment agreement. The terms of this Article shall not apply to employees paid from grant, contract or institute funds. Such employees, however, shall receive a thirty day notice of impending layoff unless a predetermined date for the end of employment has been established and shall be placed in the on campus call back pool for two years pursuant to section G. The terms of this Article shall not apply to probationary employees.\n\nB. The appointing authority agrees that it will hold a layoff meeting with the Association to discuss the impact of pending layoffs and to explore alternatives for laid off employees. Upon notification, the Association shall make itself promptly available for such meeting.\n\nLayoffs shall be conducted by job classification on the basis of the employee's campus seniority provided the employee retained has the ability to perform the job. In the event of a layoff within a job classification, probationary employees within that job classification shall be laid off first with regard to their individual periods of employment. Non-probationary employees shall be next to be laid off.\n\nD.\na) Employees who are on layoff shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employee recalled has the ability to perform the job.\n\nb) Employees who would have been laid off except that they exercised their options under Sections F and G and accepted positions in lower graded classifications from the one they held before the layoffs shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employees recalled have the ability to perform the job. Said employees shall retain the right to be recalled for one year from the date of their layoff.\n\nE. Layoff in excess of three (3) continuous months shall not be credited or accrued towards seniority for any purpose.\n\nF. In the event a non-probationary employee is scheduled to be laid off, and there exists a position in an equal or lower- graded classification which either the employee has previously held on campus, or where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the requirements of the employee in his/her present position and which the employee can perform after a standard orientation period, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such employees to bump one of the three least senior individuals in such a classification covered by this Agreement provided that\nthat individual\u2019s seniority does not exceed that of the employee scheduled to be laid off.\n\na) An employee scheduled to be laid off from a clerical unit position shall first seek to bump one of the three least senior individuals in his/her current classification. If there is no position available or if the bump is denied, he/she may next seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal requirements of the employee\u2019s present position.\n\nb) An employee scheduled to be laid off from a technical or administrative unit position may initially choose to bump one of the three least senior individuals who is either in his/her current classification, in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus or who is in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal duties of the employee\u2019s present position. If a position in the selected category is not available or the bump is denied, he/she may then choose to bump one of the three least senior employees in his/her choice of the two remaining categories. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump the least senior employee from the remaining category.\n\nc) For purposes of this Article, the regular duties of a position are those listed on the Form 30 for that position provided the duties described on the Form 30 do not exceed the level, tenor and complexity of the state specification. The University shall provide Form 30\u2019s when the Association makes a specific request for good reason.\n\nG. In the event an employee is scheduled to be laid off, or is on layoff status as set forth in Article 23 (D) and there exists a vacant position in the bargaining unit which has been certified for filling in an equal or lower-graded classification, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such an employee to fill such position, provided the employee can perform the work. Any employee in such category shall have their name forwarded for any vacant position prior to Article 17 being applicable.\n\nH. Employees to be laid off will be notified of such layoff in writing, as soon as practicable, but in no event less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the layoff. The Association will be sent a list, from the appointing authority, of the employees being laid off at the same time as the written notices are given to the employees. The University will provide, within five (5) calendar days, the Form 30\u2019s and other information necessary for an employee scheduled to be laid off to make an informed decision on bumping options.\n\nI. In the event of layoff, the Division of Human Resources shall make every reasonable effort to obtain preferential treatment during the layoff period for the affected employee(s) in enrolling in training courses offered by the University.\nJ. Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, Association stewards, in the event of a layoff, shall be offered the first open job in the bargaining unit which they can perform in their specific district. Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, eleven Association officials, including the grievance officer, chief stewards and the most senior stewards shall, in the event of a layoff, continue to be employed at all times, provided they can perform the duties of any available bargaining unit positions.\nARTICLE 23\nSENIORITY\n\nSection 1. Definition of Seniority.\n\nSeniority is defined as the length of time an employee in a full time or regular part time position has been continuously employed from the last date of hire by the campus notwithstanding the source of funding.\n\nSection 2. Extension of Seniority.\n\nIn the case of institute, grant or contract employees, seniority for the purpose of applying for vacant positions shall be extended two (2) years beyond the actual expiration date of the then current funding source.\n\nSection 3. Termination of Seniority.\n\nAn employee's seniority shall be terminated and his/her rights under this Agreement forfeited for the following reasons:\n\nA. Discharge for cause, resignation or retirement.\n\nB. Exceeding an authorized leave of absence unless excused by the appointing authority.\n\nC. Failure to return to work within three (3) calendar days after notification of recall from layoff by the appointing authority. Such notice shall be by registered mail to the last address furnished to the Campus by the employee.\n\nD. If an employee is laid off for a continuous period of two (2) years or his/her length of service, whichever is less.\n\nE. If an employee gives a false reason for a leave of absence.\n\nF. Acceptance of a settlement for total and permanent disability.\n\nG. Absence from work for fourteen (14) work days without valid reasons and proper and timely notification to the appointing authority except when excused by the appointing authority.\nARTICLE 24\nTUITION REMISSION\n\nA. In addition to Section B below, the Employer agrees to maintain all other tuition benefits which employees covered by this Agreement enjoyed under policies and agreements with the Employer immediately prior to the effective date of this Agreement; these benefits shall not be limited or precluded by the provisions of this Article.\n\nB. Full-time Employees\n\nI.

Such committee shall function continuously throughout the life of this Agreement.\n\nSection 3. Career Ladder Training Fund\n\nThe Employer agrees to contribute thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per fiscal year for each full-time equivalent employee to establish a Career Ladder Training Fund to be available for all members of the unit. The parties recognize the need to provide members of the bargaining unit with opportunities to advance to more responsible positions within the bargaining unit. As such, such funds may be utilized for unit members to pay for individual educational and training programs, in order to improve working skills and knowledge beyond the normal requirements for the position presently held by such employee. A program must be given advance approval and certified by the Career Ladder Training Committee. Such committee will develop guidelines to review proposed programs and internal committee procedures during the initial year of this Agreement.\n\nThese funds may not be used to enhance salary rates or as a salary bonus. In addition to the programs above, a bargaining unit member may request reimbursement from or expenditure of such funds for any educational or training purpose, including, but not limited to supplies and equipment.

It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement to use their best efforts to encourage the informal and prompt settlement of grievances which may arise between the Association or an employee or group of employees and the Employer. Therefore, the parties agree that they shall use the procedures set forth in this Article for the resolution of all disputes involving the interpretation or application of this Agreement, unless such matters have been specifically excluded from these procedures. Further, each party hereby waives its right, if any, and the rights if any, of all those whom it represents, to use any other procedure established by law to initiate binding arbitration of grievances.

Intermediate Supervisor - The term \"Intermediate Supervisor\" for the purpose of this Article shall mean the intermediate work supervisor designated by the CEO.\n\nSection 3. Procedures for Filing a Grievance\n\nA grievance may be filed at the level at which the action or inaction being grieved occurred. If the hearing officer at the level at which the grievance is filed finds that the grievance has been filed at the wrong level, it will be returned to the grievant(s) without prejudice for filing at an appropriate level. A grievant shall institute the grievance procedure\nof this Article by filing at the appropriate level a written notice that a grievance exists. No such notice may be filed more than twenty (20) days from the date of the occurrence of the event or the date on which the unit member had reasonable knowledge of the event or conditions upon which the grievance is based.\n\nA. Step 1: Immediate Supervisor - A grievant may institute the grievance procedure of this Article by filing with his/her Immediate Supervisor a written notice that a grievance exists. The Immediate Supervisor shall within five (5) days from receipt of the grievance arrange to meet with the grievant and attempt to resolve the grievance and respond in writing within ten (10) days of the date of the meeting.\n\nB. Step 2: Intermediate Supervisor. If the grievant elects to proceed to this Step, then within ten (10) days after the receipt of the Step 1 decision, he/she shall file a Grievance with the Intermediate Supervisor, and a copy of the grievance with the Immediate Supervisor, who, upon receipt of such notice, shall forward the grievance record to the Intermediate Supervisor. The Intermediate Supervisor shall within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance arrange to meet with the grievant to resolve the dispute and shall respond in writing within ten (10) working days from the date of the meeting.\n\nC. Step 3: Chief Executive Officer of the Campus or designee (hereinafter in this Article \"CEO\"). If the grievant elects to proceed to this Step, then within ten(10) days of receipt of the Step 2 decision, he/she shall send a notice of this intent to the CEO and a copy of the notice to the Intermediate Supervisor, who, upon receipt of said notice shall forward the grievance record to the CEO. The CEO shall within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance arrange to meet with the grievant for a review of the grievance and shall respond in writing within ten (10) days of the date of the meeting.\n\nD. Step 4: The President of the University of Massachusetts or designee. (Hereinafter in this Article, the President). If the grievant elects to proceed to this Step, then within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step 3 decision, he/she shall file a notice of this intent with the President and a copy of such notice with the CEO. The CEO shall forward, forthwith, a complete copy of the grievance record to the President. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice required to initiate this Step or of a brief if the Association elects to so submit, the President shall review said grievance and issue a written decision. A brief must be submitted within ten (10) working days of the notice of appeal.\n\nMediation. The parties may agree as an alternate to Step 4 to refer the matter to Grievance Mediation. A grievance mediator may be requested from the Massachusetts Board of Conciliation and Arbitration or the parties may agree on the choice of a neutral mediator. If after sixty (60) days the grievance is not settled, the Association may proceed to Step 5 Arbitration. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the parties. All statements, documents, communications and correspondence made during or concerning grievance mediation shall not be admissible at Arbitration. The parties understand the purpose of the prior sentence is to facilitate communications during mediation and not to prevent the introduction of otherwise admissible evidence at arbitration.\nE. Step 5: Arbitration\n\n1. Initiation of Arbitration: Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the Step 4 decision, arbitration of a grievance may be initiated subject to and in accordance with the following provisions:\n\na) The Association shall have the exclusive right to initiate arbitration of a grievance.\n\nWhenever the Association shall initiate arbitration of a grievance, the resolution of which has been previously sought by a member or members of the Association then such member or members shall join in or shall be deemed to have joined in, as a party to said proceeding and shall be bound in all respects by the decision of the arbitrator to the same extent as the Employer and the Association.\n\nb) The Association may initiate arbitration of a grievance only if the resolution of the grievance has been sought through all applicable prior Steps of the grievance procedure, except as is otherwise provided in Article 26 hereof;\n\nc) The Association shall initiate arbitration by giving written notice to the President and the CEO within the said fifteen (15) days that it intends to submit a grievance to arbitration.\n\nd) The Association and the Employer and/or the appointing authority shall select an arbitrator from the following panel of arbitrators: Gary Altman, Timothy Buckalew, Richard Boulanger, Nancy Peace, Joan Dolan. The arbitrators shall be used alternately. If the next in line cannot be available in a reasonable period of time, the next shall be selected.\n\ne) The arbitrator shall convene a hearing on the issue presented by the Association giving due regard to the necessity of the parties for time to prepare and the availability of witnesses, if any. The arbitrator shall give at least ten (10) days notice to the parties of the scheduled hearing date.\n\nf) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel at any hearing convened by the arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Article. All proceedings before the arbitrator, including his/her jurisdiction to inquire into any issue presented by the grievance and his/her authority to render an award, shall be governed solely by the provisions of this Article.\n\n2. Decision of the Arbitrator: Within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the arbitrator shall determine:\n\na) Whether the Association and, where an employee or group of employees sought resolution of the grievance through the applicable Steps of this Article, such employee or group of employees, has\ncomplied with the procedures for initiating and pursuing a grievance as set forth in this Article;\n\nb) Whether the complaint alleges an express breach of the contract;\n\nc) Whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction to arbitrate;\n\nd) Whether an express provision of this Agreement has been violated in its application to the grievant.\n\nThe arbitrator shall render a decision in writing, shall state the reasons therefor, and shall promptly provide copies of the decision to the parties to the arbitration proceeding.\n\nAnything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, in making a decision the arbitrator shall apply the express provisions of this Agreement and shall not alter, amend, extend, or revise any term or condition hereof. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the arbitration proceeding and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nCosts of Arbitration: In all arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be paid fifty per cent (50%) by the Association and fifty per cent (50%) by the University. In all other respects the parties shall bear their own costs of arbitration.\n\nSection 4. Association Representation\n\nAny member of the Unit may initiate and pursue a grievance through the first four (4) Steps of the grievance procedure without intervention by any agent of the exclusive representative, provided that the exclusive representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at any conference held and that any adjustment made shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any employee may request that the Association represent him/her at any Step of the grievance procedure. No other representation shall be permitted. The Association shall notify the Immediate Supervisor, the department head, the CEO and the Chancellor, as the case may require, of the name and address of such Association representative at the time he/she is so authorized to represent the grievant.\n\nSection 5. Waiver, Admission and Termination\n\nA. Waiver - Failure of a grievant to comply with any of the provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to seek resolution of the grievance under the terms of this Agreement. In determining whether there has been any such failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Article, time shall be deemed to be of the essence, and any failure of the grievant to comply with any of the time limits prescribed herein shall be deemed to be such failure to comply with the provisions of this Article; provided, however, that the time limits prescribed herein may be extended in any specific instance by mutual written agreement of the parties. Failure\nof the Employer/University Administration to respond to any grievance within the specified time limits of this Article shall mean that the grievant(s) or the Association may take the grievance to the next level of the grievance procedure.\n\nB. Admission - The resolution of a grievance by the Immediate Supervisor, the department head, the CEO, the Chancellor, or any of their designees, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to be an admission by the Employer that the grievance has, for any other purpose or proceeding, standing as a grievance or constitutes an admission of any violation or breach of the terms of this Agreement, or is cognizable or justiciable according to any applicable provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth.\n\nC. Termination - If any party to this Agreement or any employee shall initiate any proceeding relating to a grievance in any administrative or judicial forum, or pursuant to any administrative procedure adopted from time to time by the Board of Trustees , while a proceeding relating to such grievance is pending under any provision of Section 3 of this Article, such Section 3 proceeding shall terminate as of the date of the initiation of such other proceeding and the grievance procedures aforesaid shall be inapplicable to such grievance.\n\nD. Grounds of Appeal - The Employer and the Association shall have the right to appeal any final decision of the arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 150E, s8, and Chapter 150C, s10, 11 and 12 of the General Laws.\n\nSection 6. Collateral Consequences of a Grievance\n\nThe fact that a grievance is alleged by a member of the bargaining unit, regardless of the ultimate disposition thereof, shall not be recorded in the Official Personnel File of such member; nor shall such fact be used in the making of any recommendation for the job placement of such member; nor shall such member or any other member or members who participate in any way in the grievance procedure be subjected to any action by the appointing authority whether disciplinary or otherwise, for having processed such grievance; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall derogate or be deemed to derogate from the right of the appointing authority to take any action that might be authorized or required to be taken to give effect to the resolution of any grievance.\n\nSection 7. Application\n\nThe parties hereby agree that the provisions of Section 53 of Chapter 30 of the General Laws are, in their entirety, hereby rendered of no force and effect in their application to members of the bargaining unit.\nARTICLE 28\nPERSONNEL RECORDS\n\nEach employee shall have the right, upon request, to examine and copy all material except that covered by waivers, including any and all evaluations, contained in the official personnel records maintained by the Division of Human Resources concerning such employee. The Association shall have access to an employee\u2019s records upon written authorization by the employee involved. Whenever any evaluative material is inserted into the personnel file or records of an employee, such employee shall be promptly notified and given a copy of such material. The Association or any employee may challenge the accuracy or propriety of a personnel evaluation by filing a written statement of the challenge in the personnel file. An employee may file a grievance based on a personnel evaluation which results in a negative action. Upon determination at any Step of the grievance procedure that such material is improperly placed in such employee\u2019s personnel records such material shall be removed.\n\nAn employee who wishes to have adverse material removed from their University Personnel File may make a written request for such removal to the Labor Relations Administrator. In making a decision as to whether material will be removed, the Administrator shall consider the time which has elapsed since the material was placed in the employee\u2019s file, the employment record of that employee prior to and after the material was placed in the file, and the importance of the material to maintaining necessary information about an employee\u2019s University service. In the case of material that is more than three (3) years old, the decision of the Administrator shall be subject to review through the grievance arbitration procedure as to whether the decision to not remove material was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nA copy of any evaluative or disciplinary material that comes into the campus Human Resources Office for an individual\u2019s personnel file and which does not indicate that a copy was provided to the bargaining unit member or contained the bargaining unit member\u2019s signature, will be sent to the bargaining unit member.\nARTICLE 29\nEMPLOYEE EVALUATION\n\nSection 1.\n\nPerformance evaluations are designed to serve the needs of both the employee and employer. An organized program for employee performance evaluation will:\n\nA. Improve employee satisfaction and potentially reduce employee absenteeism, turnover, and grievance;\n\nB. Serve as an important motivational tool and improve the quality of job performance;\n\nC. Enhance the ability to achieve Affirmative Action goals through improved supervisor-employee communication;\n\nD. Base personnel actions on objective, accurate and fair performance appraisals;\n\nE. Monitor the performance of probationary employees on a timely basis. Performance evaluation is the review and rating of all factors relevant to an employee's effectiveness on the job. It involves observation, guidance, training and open communication between the employee and supervisor. For it to be of significant benefit to both the individual employee and the employer, it should be a continuous process. Performance evaluation should be seen primarily as a developmental tool. Its purpose is to assess an employee's job related strengths and weaknesses and develop his/her competence to the fullest. In a correctly executed evaluation, the supervisor and the employee work together to find the means by which the employee's ability can be strengthened and directed.\n\nSection 2.\n\nA Performance evaluation of an employee shall be made annually by the supervisor within sixty (60) days prior to the anniversary date of initial hire or appointment to the employee's present position with the exception of a probationary employee who shall be evaluated at the completion of the first three (3) months of probationary service and within one month prior to the completion of the probationary period. For any bargaining unit position in which an employee's immediate supervisor is not a University employee, the employee's evaluation shall be independently reviewed by the employee's University-employed intermediate supervisor. Such evaluation will be recorded in writing on the form attached hereto, as Appendix A and shall be made on the basis of the following criteria:\nA. Quality and quantity of work;\n\nB. Work habits;\n\nC. Work attitudes;\n\nD. Working relationships with others;\n\nE. Supervisory ability (if employee supervises others).\n\n    Failure to conduct an evaluation in a timely fashion shall be deemed to mean \"Meets Expectations.\"\n\nSection 3.\n\nA. To the extent possible, an employee who may be nearing a \u201cFails to Meet Expectations\u201d rating shall be counseled by his/her supervisor at least three months in advance of the final stage of the evaluation as to the specific areas that must be improved and what he/she must do to attain a \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d rating.\n\nB. Each employee shall receive a written copy of his/her evaluation and shall be entitled to discuss the evaluation with his/her immediate supervisor and, if requested, with the supervisor of the next higher level than the immediate supervisor who has been assigned to review the performance evaluation. For the purpose of this article, the term immediate supervisor shall mean an individual who is outside of the bargaining unit.\n\n    Upon receipt of a \u201cFails to Meet Expectations\u201d evaluation the employee shall receive a remedial plan on how to reach a \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d rating.\nThe re-evaluation period shall be up to 180 days in length. An employee may request to have his/her re-evaluation done at any time during the re-evaluation period with thirty (30) days notice to the supervisor to determine if a \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d rating has been achieved. If an employee receives a \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d evaluation during the re-evaluation period, he/she shall be eligible for the denied Step and/or denied salary increase effective the first full payroll week after the date of receiving the \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d review.\n\nE. An employee\u2019s rating during the re-evaluation process shall not retard his/her anniversary date for Step purposes.\n\nSection 4.\n\n    The Personnel Administrator shall receive all evaluations from the immediate supervisors and shall retain such evaluations, together with any recommendations made on the basis of any such evaluation, and any evidence or materials submitted\nin support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator or designee shall determine whether a rating of \"Exceeds Expectations,\" \"Meets Expectations\" or \"Fails to Meet Expectations\" shall apply.\n\nSection 5.\n\nThe Personnel Administrator shall receive all evaluations from the immediate supervisors and shall retain such evaluations, together with any recommendations made on the basis of any such evaluation, and any evidence or materials submitted in support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator and/or designee shall determine whether a rating of \"Exceeds Expectations,\" \"Meets Expectations\" or \"Fails to Meet Expectations\" shall apply. The point average of an employee, who is eligible to receive a salary rate increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 1, B and C, or a step increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 3, shall be compiled as follows:\n\n- For a rating of Superior, four (4) points should be granted;\n\n- For a rating of Above Standard, three (3) points shall be granted;\n\n- For a rating of Good, two (2) points shall be granted;\n\n- For a rating of Fair, one (1) point shall be granted;\n\n- For a rating of Unsatisfactory, zero (0) points shall be granted.\n\nThe total number of points shall then be divided by the number of categories rated (exclude not applicable). The result shall be the employee's point average for salary purposes. A point average of 2.0 or higher shall indicate the employee \"Meets Expectations.\"\n\nSection 6.\n\nAny evaluation so retained in respect of any employee may be reviewed by such employee in the office of the Personnel Administrator at any reasonable time upon prior written notice. Such employee shall have the right to file a written statement in response to any such evaluation.\nSection 7.\n\nA. An employee may not grieve the substance of his/her evaluation, except where such evaluation results in a negative action. A negative action shall include denial of a pay raise or a step increase. Thirty days after the execution of this Agreement, the Labor/Management Committee will meet to discuss alternative ways to appeal a negative evaluation.\nEmployees may grieve the evaluation procedure, as set out in the preceding Sections of this Article, to step four (4) of the grievance procedure.\nARTICLE 30\nLABOR/MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\nThere shall be established a Committee at the University to be known as the Labor/Management Committee. Such Committee shall be comprised of six (6) members: three (3) representing the campus administration and three (3) representing the Association. Such representatives shall respectively be appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the campus and the Association. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer of the campus shall designate the chairperson for the local campus administration and the Association shall designate the chairperson for the Association. The purpose of said Committee shall be to discuss matters of mutual concern to the campus and the Association and discussions shall include professional training and career ladders and the impact on employees of technological changes in the workplace. The Labor-Management Committee shall meet within sixty (60) days of the execution of this Agreement and shall meet every other month, unless mutually agreed otherwise, with the position of chairperson alternating between the campus administration and the Association. Both parties may submit items for the agenda to the chairperson at least two (2) weeks in advance of any scheduled Committee meetings. The agenda shall be distributed one (1) week in advance of any scheduled Committee meetings. It is understood that said Committee shall not discuss pending grievances and shall have no power to negotiate, alter, or amend the terms of this Agreement.\nARTICLE 31\nNO STRIKES/NO LOCKOUT\n\nSection 1.\n\n    Neither the Association nor any employee shall engage in, induce, support, encourage, or condone a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by employees.\n\nSection 2.\n\n    The Association shall exert its best effort to prevent any violation of Section 1 of this Article and, if such action does occur, to exert its best effort to terminate it.\n\nSection 3.\n\n    The Employer agrees not to engage in the lock-out of unit employees.\nARTICLE 32\nPARKING AND TRANSPORTATION\n\nSection 1.\n\nProper parking facilities shall be available to the employees covered by this Agreement within reasonable proximity of their regular work location in accordance with the provisions of the University Transportation and Parking Program. The appointing authority shall endeavor to maintain adequate lighting in all parking areas and shall endeavor to maintain adequate security to insure the safety of all employees using campus parking facilities. The appointing authority agrees to discuss with the Association any proposed changes in the Parking and Transportation program and will inform the Association and all employees prior to implementing any such change.\nARTICLE 33\nSAVINGS CLAUSE\n\nIf any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in any manner conflict with, or contravene any federal or state law, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, such provisions shall be considered null and void and shall not be binding on the parties hereto; in such event, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the Employer agrees to reopen negotiations on said issue(s). The provisions of this Article notwithstanding, the parties may, by mutual agreement, upon the request of one or both parties, reopen negotiations on the provisions of this Agreement prior to the expiration date as provided in Article 34.\nARTICLE 34\nDURATION\n\nThis Agreement shall be for the three (3) year period from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2004 and terms contained herein shall become effective on the date of its execution by the parties unless otherwise specified. At the written request of either party, negotiations for a subsequent agreement will be commenced on or after March 1, 2004.\n\nThis Agreement will remain in full force and effect until a new Agreement is executed or an impasse in negotiations is reached.\n\nNothing herein shall derogate from the legal rights and duties of the respective parties relative to matters that impact mandatory subjects of collective bargaining.\nSigned this ______ day of ____________, 2001\n\nFor the University Staff Association:\n\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n\nFor the Board of Trustees\nUniversity of Massachusetts:\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B\nTEMPORARY WORK ASSIGNMENT FORM\n\nThis form must be completed by an employee who has been assigned by his/her immediate supervisor to perform the duties of a higher rated position.\nThis form must be completed and submitted to your immediate supervisor no later than the tenth day of your performance of the higher rated position's duties.\n\n______________________________\nName of Employee\n___________________________    _______________________________\nEmployee Number                Title of Present Position\n______________________________    _______________________________\nTitle and Grade of Higher Rated Position   Previous Incumbent of Position\n____________________________________    __________________________________\nEffective Date of Assignment           Estimated Duration of Assignment\n\n____________________________________\nReasons for Assignment\n\n___________________________    _______________________________\nSignature of Employee             Date of Signature\n\n___________________________    _______________________________\nName and Signature of Immediate Supervisor   Date of Signature\n\nIMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR MUST FORWARD ORIGINAL TEMPORARY WORK ASSIGNMENT FORM TO THE PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATOR ALONG WITH A COMPLETED PERSONNEL ACTION FORM.\n\nApproval _______ Disapproval (Reasons)____________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________\nName and Signature of Personnel Administrator\n\ncc.

The address of the department shall be on the back.\n\nUnit members, in other departments, who currently are required to wear identification badges shall continue to wear such badges in their current format during working hours.\n\nUnit members shall not be required to wear identification badges unless all members of the department requiring badges are required to wear badges.\n\nDiscipline of unit members who do not comply with department identification badge procedures shall follow the contractual requirement for \"just cause\" and shall be grievable.\n\nIf the Employer wishes to expand the identification badge requirements, said changes shall be mutually agreed to by the parties.\n\nFor the University: ____________________________    For the Association: ____________________________\n\n______________________________                ______________________________\n______________________________                ______________________________\n______________________________                ______________________________\n\nDate: ____________________________    Date: ____________________________\nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\n\nThe University of Massachusetts and the University Staff Association/Massachusetts Teachers Association are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides for employees covered by the terms and conditions of the Agreement to have their salaries directly transferred electronically. Whereas the Association has expressed concern that not all members would be able to avail themselves of the electronic transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1) The University and the Association agree that all employees will have their net salary checks electronically forwarded to an account or accounts selected by the employee.\n\n2) In the extraordinary event that the Association alleges that an employee cannot comply with the agreement relative to transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or there is no ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employees' work site or home, the Association shall petition the University Human Resource Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption.\n\n3) The University Human Resource Division shall review the request for Direct Deposit Special Exemption and will notify the Association of its finding.\n\n4) The parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or the Association relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and, further, that the terms of this Memorandum are not grievable and are not arbitrable.\n\nFor the University:                For the Association:\n\n__________________________________________\n__________________________________________\n__________________________________________\n__________________________________________\n__________________________________________\n\nDate______________________________    Date______________________________\nSIDE LETTER 1\n\nThe University acknowledges receiving the Association's demand to reopen the prior collective bargaining agreement due to raises given other Unions. The University agrees with the Association to continue to discuss this re-opener during the life of this Agreement. The University agrees to discuss the issue of vacation payment upon death or termination with the Association during the life of this Agreement. If it is determined the limitation on such payment is violative of law the University will amend the contract in accord with such determination.\nSIDE LETTER 2\nADMINISTRATIVE COMPUTING AND PAYROLL SYSTEMS\n\nThe parties acknowledge that the University will be implementing new administrative computing and payroll systems. To ensure that the changes required by these systems are introduced and implemented in the most effective manner, the Union agrees to accept the University's implementation and changes to business practices, procedures, and functions as are necessary to achieve such implementation (e.g. the change from a weekly to biweekly payroll system). The University and the Union will establish a Special Labor-Management Committee made up of an equal number of Union representatives and Management representatives. This committee shall be the sole forum for the parties to discuss any issues of impact to the bargaining unit arising from the implementation of the systems. The parties will reopen negotiations subject prior to implementing any change which has the effect of reducing a unit member's pay in any fiscal year.\nSIDE LETTER 3\nPARKING\n\nThe University agrees to enter into multi-union negotiations, after the execution of this Agreement, on Amherst campus parking rates. If, in these negotiations, no agreement is reached by May 1, 1999, the University can implement its last best offer without the Union filing a grievance or other action before an administrative agency. If the multi-union negotiations do not take place, the parties to this Agreement agree to resume negotiations on this issue.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2026-02-17", "created": "2026-02-17",
