ARTICLE 18
CONTRACTING OUT

When the contracting out of work which will result in the layoff of employees, who perform the function that will be contracted out, is contemplated, but prior to its implementation, a Special Labor Management Committee will be established to advise the CEO on the contracting out of personnel services. The Committee shall consist of four persons, two designated by the Association and two designated by the Director of Human Resources. Said Committee shall examine cost effectiveness, quality of work, impact on career development, availability of positions within the University for which any laid-off employee may be qualified and the availability of applicable training programs and make appropriate recommendations to the CEO.

When the decision to implement the contracting out is finalized, the appointing authority will notify the Association and discuss the decision and the availability of positions within the University for which the laid-off employee is determined to be qualified and the availability of any training programs which may be applicable to the employee. In reviewing these placement possibilities, every effort will be made to seek matches of worker skills and qualifications with available, comparable positions.
