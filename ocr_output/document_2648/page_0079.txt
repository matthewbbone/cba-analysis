ARTICLE 29
EMPLOYEE EVALUATION

Section 1.

Performance evaluations are designed to serve the needs of both the employee and employer. An organized program for employee performance evaluation will:

A. Improve employee satisfaction and potentially reduce employee absenteeism, turnover, and grievance;

B. Serve as an important motivational tool and improve the quality of job performance;

C. Enhance the ability to achieve Affirmative Action goals through improved supervisor-employee communication;

D. Base personnel actions on objective, accurate and fair performance appraisals;

E. Monitor the performance of probationary employees on a timely basis. Performance evaluation is the review and rating of all factors relevant to an employee's effectiveness on the job. It involves observation, guidance, training and open communication between the employee and supervisor. For it to be of significant benefit to both the individual employee and the employer, it should be a continuous process. Performance evaluation should be seen primarily as a developmental tool. Its purpose is to assess an employee's job related strengths and weaknesses and develop his/her competence to the fullest. In a correctly executed evaluation, the supervisor and the employee work together to find the means by which the employee's ability can be strengthened and directed.

Section 2.

For any bargaining unit position in which an employee's immediate supervisor is not a University employee, the employee's evaluation shall be independently reviewed by the employee's University-employed intermediate supervisor. Such evaluation will be recorded in writing on the form attached hereto, as Appendix A and shall be made on the basis of the following criteria:
