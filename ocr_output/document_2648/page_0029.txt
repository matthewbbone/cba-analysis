B. At the expiration of the maternity or adoptive leave, the employee will be restored to her previous position or similar position with the same status, pay, and length of service credit as of the date of her leave. If during the period of the leave, employees in the same or similar position in the department have been laid off through no fault of their own, the employee will be extended the same rights or benefits, if any, extended to employees of equal length of service in the same or similar position in the department.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the maternity or adoptive leave granted under this Article shall not affect the employee’s right to receive any contractual benefits for which he/she was eligible at the time of the leave. Upon the expiration of a maternity or adoptive leave, an additional eight (8) weeks leave may be granted at the discretion of the CEO. The leave shall be unpaid unless the employee chooses to use any accrued vacation, personal leave or compensatory time to cover this period of absence. The period of unpaid leave shall not be included in any computation of contractual benefits, rights or advantages. Not later than two (2) weeks prior to the expiration of the eight-week maternity or adoptive leave, an employee may request a return to work at reduced time. If approved by the CEO, said employee will accrue benefits in the same proportion that such part-time service bears to full-time service.

An employee on maternity or adoptive leave may have her group health insurance benefits continued for the period of time the employee is absent on such leave. The employee, while on leave, is required to pay the same monthly premium he/she would have paid had such leave not been taken.

During the first ten (10) work days of maternity leave, birth of a baby leave, adoptive leave, or foster care leave, the employee shall receive his/her regular weekly salary. When an eligible full-time or part-time employee and his/her eligible spouse are both employees of the University, they shall jointly be entitled to a combined total of not more than ten (10) days paid under this provision.

Section 8. Parental Leave.

Upon written application to the appointing authority, including a statement of any reasons, any employee who has completed any applicable probation period and who has been employed at least three (3) consecutive months and who has given at least two (2) weeks prior notice of his/her anticipated date of departure and who has given notice of his/her intention to return, may be granted parental leave for a period not exceeding ten (10) weeks. Such leave shall be without pay for such period. The purpose for which an employee may submit his/her application for such unpaid leave shall be limited to the need to care for, or to make arrangement for care of, a minor dependent child of the employee, whether or not the child is the natural, adopted or stepchild of such employee. An employee who requests and is granted parental leave for the purpose of caring for the employee’s minor dependent child under three years of age, may have his/her group health insurance benefits continued for a period of ten (10) weeks while the employee is absent on such leave. The employee, while on leave, is required to pay the same monthly premium he/she would have paid had such leave not been taken.
