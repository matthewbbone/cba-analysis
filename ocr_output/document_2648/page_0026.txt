K. Notification of absences under this Article must be given to the designated representative of the appointing authority prior to the beginning of the scheduled tour of duty and if the department head requires, at least one-half (1/2) hour prior to the beginning of the scheduled tour of duty. If such notification is not made, such absence may, at the discretion of the appointing authority, be applied to absence without pay. Where the department head requires a half-hour notice, each unit member will be duly informed of the person to be notified or the telephone number to be called. This notification period may be waived in extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

L. No employee shall be entitled to a leave under the provisions of this Article in excess of the accumulated sick leave credits due such employee (including any sick leave bank provisions).

Employees who retire shall be paid twenty (20) percent of the value of their unused accrued sick leave at the time of their retirement. It is understood that any such payment will not change the employee's pension benefit. The estate of a bargaining unit member, who dies after filing for retirement, shall be paid twenty (20) percent of the value of his/her unused accrued sick leave at the time of death. Any employee, upon retiring, may donate up to ten (10) days to the sick leave bank.
