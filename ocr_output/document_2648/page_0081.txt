in support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator or designee shall determine whether a rating of "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations" or "Fails to Meet Expectations" shall apply.

Section 5.

The Personnel Administrator shall receive all evaluations from the immediate supervisors and shall retain such evaluations, together with any recommendations made on the basis of any such evaluation, and any evidence or materials submitted in support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator and/or designee shall determine whether a rating of "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations" or "Fails to Meet Expectations" shall apply. The point average of an employee, who is eligible to receive a salary rate increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 1, B and C, or a step increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 3, shall be compiled as follows:

- For a rating of Superior, four (4) points should be granted;

- For a rating of Above Standard, three (3) points shall be granted;

- For a rating of Good, two (2) points shall be granted;

- For a rating of Fair, one (1) point shall be granted;

- For a rating of Unsatisfactory, zero (0) points shall be granted.

The total number of points shall then be divided by the number of categories rated (exclude not applicable). The result shall be the employee's point average for salary purposes. A point average of 2.0 or higher shall indicate the employee "Meets Expectations."

Section 6.

Any evaluation so retained in respect of any employee may be reviewed by such employee in the office of the Personnel Administrator at any reasonable time upon prior written notice. Such employee shall have the right to file a written statement in response to any such evaluation.
Section 7.

A. An employee may not grieve the substance of his/her evaluation, except where such evaluation results in a negative action. A negative action shall include denial of a pay raise or a step increase. Thirty days after the execution of this Agreement, the Labor/Management Committee will meet to discuss alternative ways to appeal a negative evaluation.
