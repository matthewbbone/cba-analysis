Section 1. Association Representation

Association staff representatives shall be permitted to have access to the premises of the appointing authority for the performance of official Association business, provided that there is no disruption of operations; requests for such access will be made in advance and will not be unreasonably denied. The Association will furnish the appointing authority with a list of staff representatives.

Section 2. Association Stewards

A. Association stewards shall conduct Association business in a manner which will not be disruptive of University operations and which will not interfere with the assignment and direction of employees or with the discharge of any such employee’s duties. Except as is hereinafter provided, Association business shall be conducted by Association stewards on off-duty hours, and no steward shall be paid by the Board for the performance of such business.

B. Association stewards shall be permitted to have time off without loss of pay for the investigation and processing of grievances and arbitrations. Requests for such time off shall be made in advance and shall not be unreasonably denied.

C. The Association will continue to furnish the appointing authority with a list of Association Stewards and their jurisdictions. The Association shall forthwith delineate the jurisdiction of Association Stewards so that there shall be no more than one steward for each district.
