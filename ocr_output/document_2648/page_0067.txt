ARTICLE 24A
TRAINING AND CAREER LADDERS

Section 1.

The University and the Association recognize the importance of training programs, the development of career ladders and of equitable employment opportunity structures and seek here to establish a process for generating such program recommendations and their implementation.

Section 2.

Toward these ends the University and the Association agree to establish a Training and Career Ladders Committee consisting of four (4) persons appointed by the Association and four (4) persons appointed by the University. Such committee shall function continuously throughout the life of this Agreement.

Section 3. Career Ladder Training Fund

The Employer agrees to contribute thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per fiscal year for each full-time equivalent employee to establish a Career Ladder Training Fund to be available for all members of the unit. The parties recognize the need to provide members of the bargaining unit with opportunities to advance to more responsible positions within the bargaining unit. As such, such funds may be utilized for unit members to pay for individual educational and training programs, in order to improve working skills and knowledge beyond the normal requirements for the position presently held by such employee. A program must be given advance approval and certified by the Career Ladder Training Committee. Such committee will develop guidelines to review proposed programs and internal committee procedures during the initial year of this Agreement.

These funds may not be used to enhance salary rates or as a salary bonus. In addition to the programs above, a bargaining unit member may request reimbursement from or expenditure of such funds for any educational or training purpose, including, but not limited to supplies and equipment. The University will hold title to any materials and equipment purchased in whole or in part with such funds. All requests must indicate the specific purpose for the expenditure and no payment shall be made without all documentation required by University policies and procedures.

Any funds not expended prior to January 1, 2004 shall be placed into a Career Ladder Training account to be expended on programs, training seminars, and other such services as agreed upon by the labor-management committee for bargaining unit members.
