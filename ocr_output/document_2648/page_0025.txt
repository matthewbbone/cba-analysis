question and the prognosis for the employee’s return to work. In cases where the employee is absent due to a family or household illness or injury, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by the medical personnel mentioned above indicating that the person in question has been determined to be ill and needing care on the days in question. In the case of a child who is sent home from school or day care, a statement provided by a licensed day car provider, a school nurse, if there is no nurse, a school official will be sufficient to excuse the first day of absence.

3. A medical statement provided pursuant to this Article shall be on the letterhead of the attending physician or medical provider as mentioned above and shall list an address and telephone number. Failure to produce such evidence within seven (7) days of its request may result at the discretion of the Appointing Authority, in denial of sick leave for the period of absence.

4. Any inappropriate use of sick leave shall be recorded as unauthorized leave without pay and may result in discipline.

F. The Appointing Authority may require that an employee, wishing to return to work after an absence of more than five (5) consecutive working days because of illness or injury, be examined by a physician designated by the appointing authority and/or by a physician of the employee’s choosing. If the appointing authority requires the employee to be examined by their designated physician, the appointing authority shall assume the cost of such examination. The results of such examination(s) must attest to the fitness of such employee to return to his/her regularly assigned duties.

G. In no event may the sick leave credits used be less than the actual time off.

H. Any employee having no sick leave credits, who is absent due to illness, may, unless otherwise notified by the employee, be placed on personal leave, or if no personal leave credits then on vacation.

I. An employee who is reinstated or re-employed after an absence of less than three (3) years shall be credited with his/her sick leave credits at the termination of his/her prior employment. An employee who is reinstated or re-employed after a period of three (3) years or more shall receive prior sick leave credits, if approved by the appointing authority, where such absence was caused by:

1. Illness of said employee,
2. Dismissal through no fault or delinquency attributable solely to said employee; or
3. Injury while in the employment of the Employer in the line of duty, and for which said employee would be entitled to receive Workers’ Compensation benefits.

J. A regular part-time employee shall not accrue sick leave credits for any month in which he/she was on leave without pay or absent without pay in the same proportion that his/her service bears to one (1) day of service of a full-time employee.
