Section 2. Overtime

A. An employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of forty hours per week.

B. An employee shall be compensated at his/her regular rate for authorized overtime work performed up to forty hours per week that is in excess of his/her regular workweek.

C. An employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of eight hours in his/her regular workday except that an employee whose regular workday is more than eight hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of his/her regular workday. The appointing authority shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, curtail the scheduled hours of an employee during the remainder of a workweek in which the employee has previously worked hours beyond his/her normally scheduled workday. This paragraph shall not apply to employees, who, because of the nature of the duties of their positions, work an irregular workday, nor shall it apply to employees who have been permitted by the appointing authority to participate in an approved voluntary flexible hours program, that has been duly authorized by the appointing authority and by the Personnel Administrator.

D. Compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation may be authorized by the CEO or designee only upon request of the employee. Compensatory time off shall be computed at the same rate as overtime compensation. It must be taken within one hundred and eighty (180) days of when it was earned, unless agreed otherwise by the CEO or designee, and the employee, to be taken at a time designated by the employee and approved by the CEO or designee. An employee may not accrue more than two hundred and forty (240) hours of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. Employees who have accrued the maximum amount shall be paid the hourly rate authorized for overtime work. Upon termination or prior to termination, an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the employee's final regular rate of pay.

E. With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on paid leave status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation. If sick leave is taken in a week of mandatory overtime, an employee may substitute three (3) days per year of alternate time (vacation, holiday, compensatory, or personal) time and up to two (2) days per year of sick time (with medical evidence provided). However, this will not be implemented until the Labor/Management Committee develops guidelines.

F. There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of the premium pay for overtime work provided for in this Agreement.
