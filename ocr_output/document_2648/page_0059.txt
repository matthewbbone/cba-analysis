ARTICLE 21
CLASS REALLOCATIONS

Section 1.

Class reallocations may be requested by the Association whenever it believes a reallocation is justified by the existence of an inequitable relationship between the positions covered by the reallocation requests and other positions covered by this Agreement. If the appointing authority agrees that such an inequity exists, the appointing authority and the Association agree to jointly petition the General Court for such class reallocation. If all incumbents of a position covered by this Agreement, for which such reallocation is sought, are paid from other than State-appropriated monies, the appointing authority agrees that money to fund the reallocation shall be budgeted for the following fiscal year by the University. If, however, the parties are unable to reach agreement, the matter shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

Section 2.

The appointing authority and the Association agree that the procedure provided in Section 1 shall be the sole procedure for class reallocation for all classes covered by this Agreement and no other class reallocations shall be granted.
