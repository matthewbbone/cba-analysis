SIDE LETTER 3
PARKING

The University agrees to enter into multi-union negotiations, after the execution of this Agreement, on Amherst campus parking rates. If, in these negotiations, no agreement is reached by May 1, 1999, the University can implement its last best offer without the Union filing a grievance or other action before an administrative agency. If the multi-union negotiations do not take place, the parties to this Agreement agree to resume negotiations on this issue.
