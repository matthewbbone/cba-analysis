ARTICLE 17
VACANCIES AND PROMOTIONS

Section 1.

A. The appointing authority is recognized as the sole authority to appoint an applicant to a vacant position. When the appointing authority determines that a vacancy is to be filled, it will be published in the "Yellow Sheet" as outlined in Article 17D. Appointments shall be published within ten (10) calendar days following the appearance of the appointee's name on the payroll register and in accordance with the further provisions of Article 17D. The appointing authority will not be obligated to consider an application for a position from an employee who has not submitted his/her request, nor registered under the current blanket policy of the appointing authority, on or before the seventh (7th) calendar day after the vacancy is posted.

B. For the purpose of this Article, promotion shall be defined as an appointment to a position of a higher job grade; a change in job title without a change in job grade shall be considered a lateral appointment.

Section 2.

All applications for a vacant position shall be divided into priority subgroups a, b, c, and d respectively. The University Employment Office shall send at one time all groups of applicants for a vacant position to the appointing authority. Only after the review, which will include interviews where appropriate, of each group has been completed and no sufficiently qualified candidate has been selected, may the appointing authority look at and review the applications of the next group. The appointing authority shall hold the applications and shall consider each group in the following order of priority:

Subgroup a– The applications of bargaining unit employees and other applicants within the targeted pool as defined by the appointing authority’s affirmative action program, only if the position has been targeted by the appointing authority’s affirmative action program.

Subgroup b – The applications of non-probationary employees within the bargaining unit.

Subgroup c – The applications of probationary unit members.

Subgroup d – The applications of non-bargaining unit persons.

In making selections from within a priority sub-group, campus seniority will govern where upon review by the appointing authority ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. Any determinations made by the appointing authority concerning the filling of vacancies from among bargaining unit applicants in subgroups a, b, and c shall be grievable to Step 4, but shall not be arbitratable. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of another bargaining unit employee then the reason for bypassing the bargaining unit employee’s seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only bargaining unit members in subgroup a may grieve appointments to targeted positions.
