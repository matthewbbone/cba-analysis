Section 9. Family Leave.

A. Upon written application to the CEO, including a statement of any reasons, any employee who has completed his/her probationary period, or if there is no probationary period who has been employed at least three (3) consecutive months and who has given at least two (2) weeks prior notice of his/her anticipated date of departure and who has given notice of his/her intention to return, may be granted Family Leave for a period not exceeding ten (10) weeks. Such leave shall be without pay or benefits for such period. The CEO may in his/her discretion, assign an employee to back fill for an employee who is on Family Leave. Such assignment may not be subject to the grievance procedure. The purpose for which an employee may submit his/her application for such unpaid leave shall be limited to the need to care for, and to make arrangements for the care of, the employee's spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, domestic partner or relative living in the same household.

B. Ten (10) days of family leave may be taken in not less than one-day increments. However, such leave requires the prior approval of the CEO.

C. If an employee has accrued sick leave, personal leave, or vacation leave credits at the commencement of his/her family leave, that employee may use such leave credits for which he/she is eligible under the sick leave, personal leave or vacation leave provisions of this Article.

D. Between periods of family leave, where an employee returns to the payroll for a period of less than two weeks, when a holiday falls during that time, no holiday pay or compensatory time shall be granted for such holiday.

Section 10. Education Leave

Employees may be granted a paid leave of absence in accordance with the policies of the University for educational purposes, to attend conferences, seminars, briefing sessions, or other functions of a similar nature that are intended to improve or upgrade the individual's skill or professional ability. The employee shall not suffer any loss of seniority or benefits as a result of such leave.

Section 11. Unpaid Personal Leave.

Unpaid personal leave, other than hereinbefore specified, may be granted by the appointing authority upon the written request of an employee at least 30 days in advance. Approval shall not be unreasonably denied. Retirement, seniority, sick leave, vacation credit and time accrual for step increase shall not accrue during the term of such leave.

Section 12. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

The parties agree that where the provisions of FMLA are more generous than the contract, FMLA will prevail.
