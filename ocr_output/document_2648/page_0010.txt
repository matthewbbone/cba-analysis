ASSOCIATION SECURITY
Dues Checkoff

Section 1.

The Association shall have the exclusive right to the checkoff and transmittal of Association dues or agency service fee on behalf of each employee.

Section 2.

An employee may consent in writing to the authorization of the deduction of Association dues from his/her wages and to the designation of the Association as the recipient thereof. Such consent shall be in a form acceptable to the appointing authority and shall bear the signature of the employee. An employee may withdraw his/her Association dues checkoff authorization by giving at least sixty (60) days notice in writing to the Association. The Association will then notify the appointing authority upon receipt of written notice from an individual employee to terminate his/her dues checkoff within twenty (20) working days of receipt of such notification. The foregoing notwithstanding, deduction of dues will automatically and immediately cease for an employee upon his or her departure from the bargaining unit. In the event that the employee is transferring to a non-bargaining unit University position, individual notification of such cessation shall be made to the Association and the employee. The Association hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the appointing authority harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from the failure of the Association to transmit the dues deduction authorization by an employee as stated above.
