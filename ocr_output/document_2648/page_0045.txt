A. Creation of Trust Agreement The parties have agreed to establish a Health and Welfare Fund under an Agreement and Declaration of Trust drafted by the Employer and executed by the Association and the Employer. Such Agreement and Declaration of Trust (hereinafter referred to as the "trust agreement") provides for a Board of Trustees composed of an equal number of representatives of the Employer and the Association. The Board of Trustees of the Health and Welfare Fund shall determine in their discretion and within the terms of this Agreement and the Agreement and Declaration of Trust such health and welfare benefits to be extended by the Health and Welfare fund to employees and/or their dependents.

B. Effective July 1, 2001, the Employer agrees to contribute on behalf of each full-time employee equivalent a total of nine dollars ($9.00) per calendar week.

D. Effective July 6, 2003, the Employer agrees to contribute on behalf of each full-time employee equivalent a total of eleven dollars ($11.00) per calendar week. Furthermore, should the Health and Welfare Trust choose out of its reserves to operate a day care reimbursement program for eighteen (18) months the $11.00 shall be raised to $12.00. The program involves reimbursement up to $500.00 per member for approved day care costs each year.

E. The contributions made by the Employer to the Health and Welfare Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to provide health and welfare benefits and to pay the operating and administering expenses of the fund. The amount of contributions for each year shall be based upon the number of full-time equivalent employees as of the last payroll period in the month of October; however, non-state-funded employees may be surveyed quarterly. The contributions shall be made by the Employer in an aggregate sum within forty-five (45) days following the end of the calendar month during which contributions were collected.
