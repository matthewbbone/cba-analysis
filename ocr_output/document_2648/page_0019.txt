ARTICLE 8
WORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES

Section 1. Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday

A. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for full-time employees shall be thirty-seven and one-half (37 1/2) hours per week excluding meal periods.

B. The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and Association stewards.

C. When the appointing authority desires to change the work schedule and/or work week of an employee, a discussion shall be held with the affected employee prior to the issuance of a written notice. Such written notice shall be given to the affected employee at least ten (10) working days in advance of the date of such contemplated change. If requested by the affected employee, written reasons for the change shall be provided within seven (7) calendar days of the request. Any such request must be made prior to the effective date of the schedule change. In no event shall such request for written reasons operate to forestall the effective date of the schedule change. In cases of emergency involving the protection of the property of the appointing authority or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the appointing authority, such discussion and/or written notice shall not be required unless such emergency continues to exist for more than five (5) working days. After that time, written reasons for the change in the work schedule and/or work week will be provided to the affected employee in the most practicable manner.

D. To the extent practicable, the normal workweek shall consist of five (5) consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable, employees in continuous operations shall receive two (2) consecutive days off in each seven-day period. This subsection would not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours program.

Subject to the needs of the department, the department head may offer to employees the opportunity to schedule working hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., provided that the total number of each employee’s working hours per day remain unchanged. However, all major departmental offices must remain open between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Upon request of a bargaining unit member, the supervisor may grant, for a specific period of time, a flexible personal work schedule, so long as the bargaining unit member can demonstrate that the proposed schedule will not interfere with or detract from the delivery of services provided or the day to day operation of the department. Request for a flexible work schedule shall not be unreasonably denied.
