ARTICLE 22
LAYOFF AND RECALL

Section 1. Definition of Layoff

A. Layoff shall be defined as the reduction of the work force due to lack of work, lack of funds, or curtailment of programs and shall not mean a termination. The appointing authority agrees that no unit employee will be laid off in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Employees hired with a minimum commitment of thirty-five (35) weeks per year shall be laid off in accordance with their employment agreement. The terms of this Article shall not apply to employees paid from grant, contract or institute funds. Such employees, however, shall receive a thirty day notice of impending layoff unless a predetermined date for the end of employment has been established and shall be placed in the on campus call back pool for two years pursuant to section G. The terms of this Article shall not apply to probationary employees.

B. The appointing authority agrees that it will hold a layoff meeting with the Association to discuss the impact of pending layoffs and to explore alternatives for laid off employees. Upon notification, the Association shall make itself promptly available for such meeting.

Layoffs shall be conducted by job classification on the basis of the employee's campus seniority provided the employee retained has the ability to perform the job. In the event of a layoff within a job classification, probationary employees within that job classification shall be laid off first with regard to their individual periods of employment. Non-probationary employees shall be next to be laid off.

D.
a) Employees who are on layoff shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employee recalled has the ability to perform the job.

b) Employees who would have been laid off except that they exercised their options under Sections F and G and accepted positions in lower graded classifications from the one they held before the layoffs shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employees recalled have the ability to perform the job. Said employees shall retain the right to be recalled for one year from the date of their layoff.

E. Layoff in excess of three (3) continuous months shall not be credited or accrued towards seniority for any purpose.

F. In the event a non-probationary employee is scheduled to be laid off, and there exists a position in an equal or lower- graded classification which either the employee has previously held on campus, or where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the requirements of the employee in his/her present position and which the employee can perform after a standard orientation period, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such employees to bump one of the three least senior individuals in such a classification covered by this Agreement provided that
