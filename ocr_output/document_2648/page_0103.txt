Memorandum of Agreement
July 1, 1995-June 30, 1998

The parties agree that unit members who work for Campus Services (Copy and Label Center, Duplicating Services, Distribution Services, Mail Services, Office and Classroom Supplies, Parking Services and Transit Services) shall be required to wear identification badges during working hours.

Badges need not be worn during meal or rest breaks or while at attendance at campus-wide meetings. Such badges shall have a picture of the employee with his/her first name and department name on the front. The address of the department shall be on the back.

Unit members, in other departments, who currently are required to wear identification badges shall continue to wear such badges in their current format during working hours.

Unit members shall not be required to wear identification badges unless all members of the department requiring badges are required to wear badges.

Discipline of unit members who do not comply with department identification badge procedures shall follow the contractual requirement for "just cause" and shall be grievable.

If the Employer wishes to expand the identification badge requirements, said changes shall be mutually agreed to by the parties.
