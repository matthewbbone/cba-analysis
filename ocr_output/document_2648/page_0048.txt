Section 3

In filling vacancies campus seniority will govern where, upon review by the appointing authority, the ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a non-bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of a bargaining unit applicant then the reasons for bypassing the bargaining unit employee's seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only a senior bargaining unit member who has been bypassed shall have the right to request such information. Under these circumstances, the appointing authority's determination may be grieved and processed through arbitration. In the event arbitration is invoked hereunder, the arbitrator's authority shall be limited to reviewing, consistent with the criteria set forth herein, the appointing authority's determination that the qualifications of the successful and unsuccessful candidates are not equal. In no event shall an arbitrator have authority to review or reverse the appointing authority's determination under Section 2 hereof that applicants within a particular priority subgroup are not sufficiently qualified. A unit member may grieve his/her non-selection for a position only to Step 4 of the grievance process if such position was awarded to another unit member.

Section 4.

The Employer shall use reasonable efforts to answer requests for information regarding the search and selection procedure submitted by the senior unit member who has been bypassed and makes such request pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 and requests made in the investigation of a grievance filed under Section 2 or Section 3.

Section 5. Trial Period

A. An employee who is appointed to a different position shall serve a three (3) month trial period from the effective date of the appointment. In no case, however, shall this trial period expire prior to the completion of six (6) months of continuous employment from the most recent date of hire.

B. During this trial period, if the employee's work performance in the new assignment is not satisfactory to the CEO said employee shall revert back to his or her former position. This matter may be a proper subject for the Grievance procedure.

C. If the employee is not satisfied with the new position, he/she may elect to return to the former position within thirty (30) days after said new appointment.

D. All appointments made related to this section shall be temporary or provisional appointments at least until the completion of the trial period. All vacancies resulting from an employee's appointment pursuant to this section shall be filled temporarily or provisionally at least until the appointed employee has completed his/her trial period. The employer shall notify all employees of this provisional appointment trial period.

Section 6.

At the time of appointment to a higher grade, an employee will receive an increment consistent with the Employee Compensation Article of this Agreement.
