ARTICLE 10
SICK LEAVE BANK

A Sick Leave Bank shall be maintained at the University, if 50% of the unit members subscribe to such bank or a minimum of one hundred (100) days is donated by the unit members, whichever is less. Such bank shall be maintained for the benefit of all those members of the bargaining unit who shall have chosen, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to become a member thereof. Any employee who is a member of this bank on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain a member thereof subject to the terms and conditions of this section. A unit member from UMass Extension, who was a member of the Non-Unit Sick Leave Bank on October 4, 1995, shall automatically become a member of the USA/MTA Sick Leave Bank without further contribution.

During the months of October, February and May, an employee who is not already a member of the Sick Leave Bank may become a member by assigning one (1) or more full days of his/her personal sick leave accumulation to the Bank; provided, however, that on the date of making such assignment the employee shall have accumulated not fewer than three (3) days of personal sick leave.

A member of the Sick Leave Bank shall be eligible to draw upon the Bank five working days after the exhaustion of the member's personal sick leave, personal leave, and any compensatory time accumulation, and all but ten (10) days of accrued vacation leave. Once an employee has used up leave in accordance with this section, they shall immediately be eligible to draw days from the Sick Leave Bank.

The Sick Leave Bank shall be administered by a joint labor-management committee with equal representation between unit members and the administration. In order to maintain membership in the Sick Leave Bank, members must donate one (1) or more full days each year if the balance in the Sick Leave Bank is less than two (2) times the number of Sick Leave Bank members. If, however, the balance of days in the Sick Leave Bank is greater than two (2) times the number of members in the Sick Leave Bank, the annual assessment of days shall cease until such time as the balance of days in the Sick Leave Bank is less than the number of members. Any member of the Bank wishing to remain a member thereof and who has exhausted his/her personal sick leave accumulation shall assign such additional full day or days as of the date on which such member is next entitled to personal sick leave. The Sick Leave Bank Committee shall be authorized to establish the schedule for determining if and when the annual assessment will occur.

To be approved to draw from the Sick Leave Bank, a Sick Leave Bank member must submit a completed Sick Leave Bank Application form completed and signed by a physician, which states the nature of the employee's illness or disability and its anticipated duration. The Sick Leave Bank member must also submit a written statement requesting to use the Sick Leave Bank.

After review and a majority affirmative vote by the Sick Leave Bank Committee, a unit employee may draw upon the Bank. The Sick Leave Bank Committee shall determine the period of time the member may draw from the Bank. After an employee has drawn from the Bank for the approved period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, his/her case shall be reviewed by the Sick Leave Bank Committee upon the written request of the employee. The employee must provide additional medical documentation to support the continuation of Sick Leave Bank use. The Sick Leave Bank Committee may, by majority affirmative vote,
