Section 11.

An employee who is reinstated or re-employed shall be entitled to his/her vacation status at the termination of his/her previous service; provided, however, that no credit for previous service may be allowed where reinstatement occurs after absence of three (3) years unless approval of the appointing authority is secured for any of the following reasons:

a) Illness of the employee.

b) Dismissal through no fault or delinquency attributable solely to the employee.

c) Injury while in the service of the Commonwealth in the line of his/her duties and for which the employee would be entitled to receive Workers' Compensation benefits.

Section 12.

An employee who is granted a leave of absence to enter service in the armed forces of the United States, under the provisions of Chapter 708 Acts of 1941 as amended, and who, upon honorable discharge from such service in said armed forces, returns to the service of the Institution, shall be paid an amount equal to the vacation leave which had been accrued prior to his/her entry into such service in said armed forces but which had not been used prior to military leave, provided that no monetary or other allowance has already been made therefor.

Section 13.

An employee who is reinstated after military leave, as referred to in Section 12, may be granted vacation allowance up to the equivalent of twelve (12) months' accrual as of the date on which he/she returned or returns, provided, that prior to such military leave, vacation had not been used or compensation paid in lieu thereof for the same year. Neither the above usage, nor absence due to military leave, shall in any way affect vacation credits accrued by such an employee in any full month of employment after he/she returns from military service.

Section 14.

Vacation leave shall accrue to an employee while on a leave with pay status or on industrial accident leave.

Vacation leave accrued following a return to duty after leave without pay or absence without pay shall not be applied retroactively against such leave of absence.
