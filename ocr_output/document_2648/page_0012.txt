ARTICLE 5
AGENCY SERVICE FEE

Section 1.

Each employee who elects not to join or maintain membership in the Association shall be required to pay as a condition of employment, beginning thirty (30) days following the commencement of employment, an agency service fee to the Association in an amount that is equal to the amount required to become and remain a member in good standing.

Section 2.

This Article shall not become operative until this Agreement has been formally executed, pursuant to a vote of a majority of all employees in that bargaining unit present and voting.

Section 3.

The Association shall reimburse the appointing authority for any expenses incurred as a result of being ordered to reinstate an employee terminated at the request of the Association for not paying the agency service fee. The Association will intervene in and defend any administrative or court litigation concerning the propriety of such termination for failure to pay the agency service fee. In such litigation, the appointing authority shall have no obligation to defend the termination.

Section 4.

Disputes between the parties concerning this Article shall be resolved in accordance with the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. In the event such a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to order the appointing authority to pay such agency fee on behalf of any employee. If the arbitrator decides that an employee has failed to pay or authorize the payment of the agency service fee in accordance with this Article, the only remedy shall be the termination of the employment of such employee if the employee continues to refuse to pay or authorize payment of the required agency service fee after having sufficient time to do so.

Section 5.

It is specifically agreed that the appointing authority assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article and the preceding Association Security Article, and the Association hereby agrees it will indemnify and hold the appointing authority harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from the termination of an employee hereunder or from deductions made by the appointing authority.
