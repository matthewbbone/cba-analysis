authorized leave without pay for their entire work day immediately preceding and immediately following a holiday shall not receive holiday pay or a compensatory day off for that holiday.

Section 6.

A unit member scheduled to work on a holiday and who fails to report as scheduled shall be recorded as absent without pay unless the unit member properly notified the appointing authority-and if required by a department head at least one-half (1/2) hour prior to the beginning of the scheduled tour of duty - and indicated, as a reason for such absence, a reason that, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, warrants the granting of a paid leave of absence for such day; provided, however, that when sickness is the reason for such absence, the unit member may be required to produce evidence in the form of a doctor's certificate within the next succeeding seven (7) day period. An employee who is granted sick leave for a holiday on which he/she is scheduled to work shall not receive holiday pay or a compensatory day off for that holiday. Where the department head requires a half-hour notice, each unit member will be duly informed of the person to be notified or the telephone number to be called. This notification period may be waived in extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

Section 7.

A full-time employee not otherwise entitled to the Suffolk County holidays, pursuant to Section 1 above, and who is scheduled to work on such holiday, shall be entitled to a day off with pay in lieu of each of the Suffolk County holidays. Additionally, a full-time employee who is not scheduled to work on a Suffolk County holiday, if the employee's usual workweek is five (5) or more days, shall be entitled to a day off with pay in lieu of each of the Suffolk County holidays. Such day off must be taken on the day the holiday is observed if the appointing authority so directs. Otherwise it may be taken by the employee at a time approved by the appointing authority, but within one hundred and eighty (180) days.

Section 8.

Whenever any holiday falls on a Sunday, such holiday shall be deemed to fall on the day following. Whenever any holiday falls on a Saturday, such holiday shall be observed on that day. A person whose regular scheduled day off is Saturday shall, where possible, be given the preceding Friday off. If it is not possible to give the preceding Friday off, the provisions of Section 3 of this Article shall apply. Such holidays shall be granted in accordance with and subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article. However, if an employee is scheduled to work on such a Saturday or Sunday, that workday shall be deemed to be the holiday in accordance with the preceding Section 4. Provided, however, that if either such day off cannot be granted for reasons satisfactory to the appointing authority, such employee shall be given a day off in lieu thereof, or shall be paid compensation therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 4.

Section 9.

A part-time employee shall earn pay for a holiday or compensatory time in the same proportion that his/her service bears to full- time service.
