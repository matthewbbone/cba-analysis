Statutory rights protected

7.14 A vi No involuntary change in placements will be effected that may compromise in any way the employee's rights under the statutory provisions.

7.14 B It is recognized that compelling, special situations may exist whereby a change of position assignments within the District is necessary to serve the interest of the employee. Such situations may be initiated by the District, the Association, or the employee concerned, and in all cases must be based on evidence which before assignment was made. When such special situations exist, the District may identify a reassignment/transfer and offer such change to the employee outside of the normal placement procedures. Typically, such options would be based on existing vacancies. However, in the most compelling situations, such reassignment/transfer may be used concurrently with the above "right" need authority of the District. Examples of appropriate special situations which might lead to:

i Transfer or reassignment of employees who have served successfully in an especially challenging and demanding assignment

ii Transfer or reassignment of a successfully performing employee who has been unsuccessful for a number of years in gaining a reassignment through normal reassignment procedures.

iii The reassignment of an employee due to a compelling personal situation that is beyond the control of the employee.
