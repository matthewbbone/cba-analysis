Article 9.11

Procedure for review & removal of derogatory material

Disciplinary letters placed in an employee's personnel file in accordance with this chapter, will be removed from the personnel file after two full years of satisfactory service. The record may be maintained in a separate master grievance or discipline file in accordance with Article 9.13. If, however, an educator who has been warned or other derogatory material placed in his/her file in the Human Resources Office may request a hearing by the Superintendent/designee each ten (10) month time period from the date it was filed to determine the necessary and lawful purposes that remain for its continued retention in the personnel file in the Human Resources Office. The materials will be removed if it can be established that the individual has remedied the fault(s) cited and/or if the District determines there is no longer a need for the retention of the materials in the file. It is recognized that the decision for removal or re-removal of material rests with the Superintendent/designee and appeals from the decision are limited to step 2 of the grievance procedure, i.e., not subject to the arbitration procedure.

Article 9.12

Administrative Inquiry/Investigation. A semi-formal administrative inquiry is a procedure normally carried out by a District level administrator or a building administrator other than an employee's assigned supervisor.

An administrative inquiry conference may be scheduled by a District or building administrator for the purpose of discussing an alleged incident(s) involving a member of the bargaining unit. The incident(s) to be discussed should be of substantial gravity that, if confirmed, would lead to disciplinary action or dismissal. The scheduling and conduct of the meeting is subject to the same conditions as apply to letters of reprimand. Copies of any written findings resulting from such an inquiry shall be provided to the employee in writing and noted that such a meeting was held but not become a part of the permanent personnel record of the employee unless the inquiry results in a letter of reprimand or more serious disciplinary action.

Article 9.13

Right of Knowledge & Access to Personnel Files, Materials, & Information

Certificated employees or former certificated employees shall upon request have the right during regular District business hours to inspect all contents of their complete personnel file kept within the District. Upon request, a copy or District copies of any data contained therein may be provided to the employee. No secret, a certificate, or other personnel file shall be kept anywhere in the District except that all records of grievance and discipline will be maintained in a separate master grievance or discipline file specifically organized for that purpose. Supervisors may retain pertinent records about events that involve employees, providing that the employees shall have access to such a file.

Article 9.14

Right of Counsel by making the review

At the request of the individual educator, other persons of his/her own choosing may be present with him/her in reviewing his/her personnel file. If an educator or music is to be present, a signed written permission and authorization for a designee to review the contents of the file may be made.
