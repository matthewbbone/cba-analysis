14.6 D Staff members will be considered for additional classifications, categories, and/or specialties only if they do not qualify for retention in the classification, category, or specialty position held at the time of implementation of these procedures.

Article 14.7

Certificated staff members shall be considered for retention or recall to vacancies in positions within the classifications, categories, or specialties for which they qualify under Article 14.6 hereof. The individual must possess a valid Washington State Certificate authorizing service in any position for which he/she is being considered or assigned. In the event that there are more qualified employees than available positions in a given classification, category, or specialty, the following criteria shall be used to determine the order of retention and recommendation for reassignment or recall from the employment pool.

Seniority consideration

14.7 A Total seniority as a certificated staff member shall be the basis for retention and recall in classifications in those categories and specialties identified in Article 14.5 above.

Within each such classification, category, or specialty, the staff member(s) having the greater seniority shall be recommended for retention.

Seniority defined

Seniority for the purposes of this Chapter should mean the total number of years an employee has served in a position with the District and/or other school districts within the state of Washington as defined in RCW 28A.400.305. The traditional nine (9) month academic year shall be considered a 1.0 school year. Part-time (partial year or day) service under a regular contract will be proportionately computed in terms of (1/9ths) of the basic school year (180 days, eight hours, 7.5 hours). However, no employee with less than one (1) school year shall be counted for seniority (12 month period). All experience to be considered for seniority must have been documented by February 1 and claimed on or before February 15 of each year (see Article 14.6 C). Professional education experience shall mean total years of experience eligible for submission to OESPT on the annual personnel report (3-275). (See Articles 11.11, 11.12, and 11.18.)

Total number of years, seniority consideration

14.7 B In the event equal seniority exists among two (2) or more staff members qualified for a position to be retained, the staff member having the highest number of credits shall be assigned to the position retained.

Drawing lots in "ties"

14.7 C In the event a tie exists in both total years of seniority and total number of credits, the tie will be broken by drawing lots among the staff members in the tie.

Assoc. Pres. super-seniority

14.7 D The president of the Association for the year of the reduced program shall be equal in seniority to the most senior certificated employee in the District.

Secondary consideration assignment, seniority computation

14.7 E A secondary counselor will be assigned to a retained secondary counseling position on the basis of higher total seniority of service as secondary counseling. For purposes of this paragraph, staff member has performed in the secondary counseling area (as defined in PTE) or has been an assistant teacher and granted the devotion to secondary counseling for at least one semester in any given year.
