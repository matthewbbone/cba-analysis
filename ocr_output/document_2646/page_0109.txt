Definition of basic workload & work year for purposes of salary schedule placement, advancement & compensation

11.8 A The standards established by the legislature and the OSPI for reporting employment (currently the S273 form) and generation of funding for compensation will be utilized for the placement of an individual on the salary schedule. Current law requires that a basic workload week or workweek/day is defined as an average weekly period of twenty-five (25) hours and an average of three hundred (300) minutes per day of teacher-student formal and informal contact time. A minimum of one half school year of credit (90 student days) is required for one (1) year of advancement on the salary schedule. No more than 1/8 school year of experience may be counted for any twelve (12) month period.

Employment of ninety (90) days full-time (for the purposes of salary schedule advancement) is defined as 3 years and one-half (7/2) continuous hours (Article 14.7 A). A double "one day" or report and over half (7/2) continuous hours (Article 10.5 B). Part-time service may be accumulated over several years to qualify for advancement on the schedule.
