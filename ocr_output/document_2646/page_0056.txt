Extracurricular-curriculum staffing needs

Each principal will also determine the positions needed in paid co-curricular and extracurricular programs for the effective operation of the school. (Article 7.5 B iv)

Discussion with building faculty regarding curriculum program & staff assignments

i Each principal will review the qualifications of the staff currently assigned to the school to try to properly place each resident staff member into identified positions in the program. The principal will meet with the building faculty advisory council (faculty representatives) to discuss program and staffing plans as soon as information is available for discussion purposes, but not later than the first week of May.

ii The principal will call for volunteers for identified building assignments or placement in the unassigned pool.

Tenure/placement plan formulated

iii The principal will tentatively place individual educators of the building staff according to the qualifications and will consider personal preferences of each educator to carry out the identified position assignments.

Human resources involvement

The principal will identify to the Human Resources Office the specific nature (responsibilities and duties) of any position not filled by current staff because of (a) increased enrollment of students, (b) presently assigned building staff lacks qualifications to fill an identified position, (c) the names of resident staff believed excess because of (1) decline in enrollment, (2) individual qualifications do not match an identified position opening, (3) student program needs.

Each principal will review with the Human Resources Office the individuals tentatively assigned as excess pursuant to established criteria followed (Article 7.9) and the specific rationale for each decision.

Employee notification of placement to "unassigned staff pool" consideration

An individual not assigned in the principal's initial staff placement plan (Article 7.8 C i) will be notified in writing by Human Resources that he/she is tentatively placed in an unassigned staff pool. The building principal will, simultaneously to the written notice, meet and confer with each teacher identified for the unassigned pool to review the rationale followed in making that decision.

Unassigned staff pool considerations

Individuals placed in an unassigned pool may complete a Position Interest Register form. The District will attempt to place individuals in areas of preference, but the District may place them in openings for which they are qualified by certification, education, or experience.

Displaced person consideration

An individual involuntarily placed will be given priority consideration for assignment into District openings in accordance with higher qualifications, preferences and total cumulative seniority as a certificated staff person in the District.

Reinstatement provision (District determination)

An employee reassigned involuntarily because of a reduction of staff will be given priority to return to the original building to a specific vacancy if qualified (as determined by the District) that may occur following further displacement providing he/she has the same or greater District seniority than another candidate vying for placement in the opening.
