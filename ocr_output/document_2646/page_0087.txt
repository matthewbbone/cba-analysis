Article 10.9
Professional improvement: shortened days
The District will schedule non-student attendance days before or during the school year for the purpose of delivering in-service programs. Scheduling of such day(s) will be consistent with the TLL time specifically set aside for this purpose in Chapter 12.
When such requests are not available and there is a clearly identified need, the District will schedule out-of-class (OOC) days or other non-student attendance days during the year, with a shortened student day, for the purpose of conducting building or District meetings or other activities specifically designed as in-service programs to improve instruction and curriculum within a building or the District. When applicable, the teachers will be surveyed for input as to the nature of topics to be included in these meetings.

Article 10.10
Traveling teachers
Teachers assigned to two (2) or more buildings shall be scheduled in such a manner as to provide a thirty (30) minute, duty-free lunch period, plus necessary travel time between buildings. The District will make every reasonable effort to avoid fractionalized assignments (i.e., scheduling an employee in multiple buildings when the schedule from the start of the day to the end of the day exceeds a normal day, or when the assignment is not consecutive time). When such situations cannot be avoided, the District will consult with the Association in determining the appropriate FTE/compensation level.

Article 10.11
Alleviate floating teacher problems
The unique problems of "floating teachers" will become a matter of discussion between the building administrator and the floating teacher before or early in the school year. The principal will attempt to develop reasonable procedures and arrangements to eliminate or alleviate problems inherent in having to teach in several different rooms during the school day. It shall be an administrative goal for each building to attempt to have a two (2) station limit for each teacher. There are times, however, because of enrollment and classroom facilities limitations that some teachers will need to teach at more than two (2) locations.

Article 10.12
Paraprofessionals
Staff assignments
30.12 A The Association and District recognize the importance and advantages of utilizing paraprofessional staff (staff assistants) in the schools and classrooms in those activities which may properly be assigned to noncertificated staff. The Association and the District also recognize that funding must be available to provide this assistance from noncertificated staff.
