Voluntary nature of paid special assignment:
13.8 E Individual educators will have the right to accept or reject the offer to provide services under a supplementary contract without fear of reprisal, e.g., poor attitude in evaluation of basic contract services, assignment to least desirable non-paid special assignments, etc. It is acknowledged by the District and Association that a qualified person must be made available in a school to serve the needs of students in the special assignment activities.

The provisions of Article 7.14 will apply in making such involuntary transfers or reassignments.
