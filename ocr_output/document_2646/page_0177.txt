Adjudication: If outcome prediction does not result in a negotiated settlement, the remaining processes involve placing the matter completely in the hands of a third party who will render a binding decision on the parties. These processes generally require more time and effort, and are generally more costly than the processes in which the parties attempt to resolve their own dispute. Therefore, parties should make every effort to use assisted negotiation and outcome prediction before placing the dispute entirely in the hands of a third party for a decision.

Arbitration:
Neutral third party listens to both parties and renders a binding decision.
Generally follows more formal processes than assisted negotiation.

Courtroom Arbitration:
Arbitration involving the use of a private court and judge who listens to both parties and renders a binding decision.

Litigation:
Binding decision rendered by a judge or jury.
Formal, lengthy, and expensive.
