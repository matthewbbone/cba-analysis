Article 7.13

Requirements for filling openings

An opening occurring after the first fifteen (15) school days of the school year and the end of the school year will generally be filled by an "active" assignment (Article 7.3 B ii) in recognition of the building staff or employment of an individual on a delegate assignment basis (Article 7.3 B iii). In general and unusual situations, and when necessary to secure qualified candidates, the District may make a continuing (non-athletic) appointment during the school year. However, normal procedures of notification will be maintained so as not to interfere with qualified employees who would otherwise be available for employment in the District on a continuing basis during a current year or for the ensuing year. In addition, the Association must be notified in advance of the recruitment action of the special and unusual situation. The Association reserves the right to oppose such action if not in agreement that special and unusual circumstances exist. Multi-year assignments will be allowed whenever such action can be reasonably construed as not excessively disruptive of present assignments, consistent with sound financial procedures and programs for students and/or to fill an opening in a position for which few current employees have the required qualifications.

Article 7.14

Involuntary and Special Situation Placements

Involuntary placements
7.14 A Involuntary changes in placement of professional educators -- transfers or reassignments -- will be effected only to accommodate urgent needs of the District. Such involuntary changes, when required, shall be accomplished in compliance with the following procedures:

Volunteers
i No opening will be filled or created by means of involuntory change, if there is a qualified employee volunteer available in the same building.

Considerations required
ii Whenever an involuntary change in placement is necessary, proper consideration will be given to any alternative assignment that fulfills the urgent needs of the District, all aspects of the individual's professional qualifications, the individual's expressed preference for placement, and the effect on his/her total compensation.

Explanation conference
iii Such involuntary changes in placement will occur only after a conference between the individual and the administrator of Human Resources and/or his/her designee, at which time the individual will be given an explanation as to why the change is essential to the urgent needs of the District, which explanation will establish a rational basis for fact.

Representation allowed
iv At the time of scheduling any such explanatory conference, the individual employee may, in his/her option, be accompanied by a representative of his/her own choosing from the Association.

Alternate vacancies provided
v At the time of any proposed involuntary change in placement, the individual employee shall have access to a complete listing of currently reported openings for which he/she is qualified in the District, and shall be afforded an alternative opportunity to apply for any vacancy so listed.
