11.12 A ii Advancement of one (1) step on the salary schedule will require a minimum of 80% of FTE year of service. Not more than one (1) year of service can be earned in one (1) school year. Part-day and part-year (regular contracted and substitute) service may be accumulated over several school years to qualify for advancement on the schedule. Multiple years of part-time service should be computed each year to determine each individual's specific salary schedule placement.

Example: Three (3) years of 80% service is equal to only 2.4 years, i.e., two (2) steps, not three (3) steps on the salary schedule. Four (4) years of 60% is equal in 3.2 years; three (3) are. Five (5) years of 80% is equal to (9) years of 100%, and five (5) years of 70% service will qualify for advancement on one (1) step on the salary schedule and the computation of seniority of an individual for other purposes of the contract, i.e., RIF placement, etc. Advancement on the Vancouver Salary Schedule is contingent for each individual case on the District being able to generate funds through the state LEAP funding regulations to reasonably fund a change in placement.

iii Group insurance benefits will be offered in direct proportion to the time spent teaching, with a minimum of 40% FTE to participate in the program.

iv Emergency sick leave, staff development funds, personal business leave, and similar other economic benefits will be computed in proportion to the individual's percent of the FTE composition, i.e., 40% minimum.

11.12 B Position Determination

i The District will arrange the sharing of one FTE position by two (2) individuals or some other fractionalization of a limited number of teacher FTE positions when:

a. The District can identify some clear advantages to the District for utilizing such an arrangement, and/or

b. The District does not identify any clear disadvantages of substance from a proposed fractionalization of an FTE unit.

The fractionalization of an FTE position must not result in substantially increasing the cost to the district for salary and benefits in excess of its average cost of funding an FTE. It will not be accomplished solely to accommodate the "preferred life style" of the employees. There must be some value being accrued by the District for the uprating of an FTE and the expansion in administration and inherent in the increase of the number of employees to be supervised and accounting records as he maintained.

ii A job sharing or other FTE fractionalization will normally be accomplished for not more than one (1) year.

It may be established without prior notice:

a. At the end of each school year
