CHAPTER 6. LEAVES

Article 6.1

General purposes of leaves & provisions:
The District and the Association recognize that limitations arise that are not of emergency nature or such other identified value to both the District and the employee as to warrant authorized periods of absence from assigned duties and responsibilities. High morale and sustained employment of an experienced and competent staff are primary objectives in the establishment of a comprehensive system of granting leaves. It is equally agreed that a certification of staff presence should not be serving students when he/she is not physically ill, mentally ill, or under a religious conviction, or is provided with leave for reasons different from those attributed to illness. However, if the staff member needs to have opportunity to improve professionally, and if a budget crisis situation arises in the District, it would need to be accommodated.

Procedure for leaves
6.1 A Applications for leaves or reimbursements for leaves must be made within time limits, in writing on proper forms, and submitted through the immediate supervisor.

Immediate supervisor level leave processing considerations
6.1 B The building principal, supervisor, or Human Resources Office must expeditiously act on the request taking into account the validity of the request, the circumstances prompting the request, the employee's ability to have a substitute, the impact of the absence on students and staff, and availability of a substitute, and any adverse effects or advantages to the school or District. The employee should generally receive a response within five (5) workdays of a complete and documented request unless school board action is required.

i Building principals, or supervisors of non-building based employees, will approve or disapprove leave under Articles 6.2 (Employee Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave), 6.3 (Bereavement), 6.5 (Adoption and Paternity), and 6.11 (Personal).

ii Building principals, or supervisors of non-building based employees, have the authority to disapprove leave under Articles 6.9 (Educational Leave – Short Term), 6.10 (Sabbatical), and 6.12 (Uncompensated – Short Term).

iii Recommendations to approve leave under these articles as well as leave requests under Articles 6.4 (Jury Duty), 6.5 (Subpoena), 6.7 (Military), 6.8 (Religious), and 6.12 (Uncompensated – Long Term), will be forwarded to the Human Resources Office for approval or disapproval.

Seniority rights
6.1 C Seniority rights will be retained while on a sabbatical or authorized uncompensated long term leave of four-fifths (4/5ths) or more of a year (see Article 14.7, seniority defined), but will not accumulate during the leave for purposes of advancement on the salary schedule (Chapter 11) or reemployment positions (Chapter 14).

6.1 D Leaves will conform to law, District policy, and regulations with collective bargaining agreement provisions taking precedent when a conflict exists between the Agreement and the policy or regulation. See also Article 19 concerning conformity to law.
