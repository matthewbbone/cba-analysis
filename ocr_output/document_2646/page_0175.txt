Types of Alternative Dispute Resolution

Unassisted Negotiation: Unassisted negotiation involves only the people embroiled in the dispute and no third parties. There are two types:

1. Competitive:
Negotiators seek to maximize their own gain at the expense of the other party;
Most effective for one-shot, single issue situations in which there will be no long-term relationship.

2. Collaborative:
Negotiators seek to find solutions that satisfy everyone's interest;
Search for joint gains rather than compromising or splitting the difference;
Appropriate where creative solutions are possible;
Best where parties will have ongoing relationship;
Builds trust and credibility.

Assisted Negotiations: These are attempts to encourage and assist the parties to jointly develop their own solution to the dispute. These processes have been shown to be favored by most parties because the parties are involved in developing their own solution, they take greater ownership of the solution than one prescribed by a third party, and the process is generally less formal and less costly than other processes.

  Bring the parties together;
  Carry messages between parties;
