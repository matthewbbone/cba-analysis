Orientation program

3.2 I The Association will be provided an opportunity during the District's orientation program (twenty (20) minutes) for newly-employed certified employees to explain the programs and operation of the Association and the rights and responsibilities of staff under the Comprehensive Professional Agreement. The agenda or format for this presentation will be provided to the District prior to the orientation.

Released time for officers' business

3.2 J An officer designated by the Association will be released from a substantial portion, or may be released from all assigned duties as may be mutually agreed to by the District and the Association for the purpose of carrying out Association activities. The District agrees to fund .5 FTE at base pay for release time and to fund 1.00 hours benefits to include any applicable TRB benefits. The Association agrees to fund any base pay cost in excess of .5 FTE and will do so by reimbursing the District in a single payment in full, or in two payments (one per semester). Any such reimbursement payment(s) will be aggregated and paid in equal payments over ten (10) student attendance months of the school year. (This provision is subject to annual review as to its fiscal and operational feasibility.) Partisan political activities during release time are prohibited.

The portion of time required for release from assigned duties will be mutually determined annually, and will be based on the specific needs and circumstances of the professional assignment in the District at that time. The Association and the District will make every reasonable effort to be credited by the District and the Association to work out specific arrangements each enough for a pending school to minimally inconvenience the Association officers and his/her immediate supervisor in the development of plans for covering duties during the periods of absence.

Released time for association business

3.2 K 1 Requests by the Association for District staff members to be released as participants or special consultants to work on Joint District-Association committees; consultants to collective bargaining activities; attendance as delegates or representatives to local, state, and national association committee meetings; workshops and conventions; attendance at the Legislature, or other and sufficient just causes, will normally be made in writing at least five (5) working days prior to the leave. The request should include a copy of the resolution from the Association's Superintendent/designee specifying the purpose and dates of release required.

When released time is authorized, it shall be subject to reimbursement to the District by the Association for the actual cost of any necessary substitute, except where the District has indicated in other provisions of this Agreement or by administrative decision that the cost of the substitute will be borne by the District. It is understood that decisions for approval of these requests rest with the District. Administrative decision is not subject to appeal beyond Step 2 of the grievance procedure.

Released time for Association's affiliate business

ii An Association member elected to serve as an officer in a state or national organization with which the Association is affiliated may be granted released time to meet out of town and regional affiliates on specified dates provided such service is not contracted for service to the District. As early in a school year as information is available, the officers of the affiliate will present to the District, through the Superintendent/designee, a list of the dates and the events that will require absence from his/her assigned duties. The scheduled times allowed for released time shall be validated by mutual agreement between the Association and the District. Necessary substitutes may be allowed during the same year as long as it is justified on the merits of each request for a deviation from the initially approved schedule. It is understood that the District reserves the right to normally place a ten-day (10) limitation for specified and valid reasons on the total number of days authorized for release of an individual for these purposes. The affiliate association utilizing the services of the Vancouver educator will reimburse the District for the actual salary cost of the assigned educator. Administrative decisions relating to this provision are not appealable beyond Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
