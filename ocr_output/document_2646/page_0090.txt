Article 10.17

Guidelines: Basic Education Class Size

Number of students
10.17 A  The number of students in a class and the kinds of students in a class are major factors that heavily impact the workload of a teacher. Every reasonable effort will be made to equalize the work load among the teachers of a school as early in the year as possible and at certain specified times during the year.

10.17 B  Specific class sizes within a school vary need to vary to meet the identified goals and to best alleviate demands on time and energy of each teacher due to subject content, materials and facilities, learning problems of student groups, unique grade level enrollment patterns in a building, and other pertinent factors as determined by the principal in consultation with his/her staff.

10.17 C  A principal will make every reasonable effort to obtain input from all interested teachers to help him/her make final determinations (of how classes are to be initially organized (reorganized during the year) as is necessary because of an increase or decrease in the number of instructional students and/or personnel) as is required by changes in student enrollment in the building.

10.17 D  A brief summary account of the reasons giving and the rationale utilized in making a final determination as to the best deployment of a building staff and for the various class sizes in a building will be made by the principal and a copy to the teachers that participated in, or will be impacted by, those discussions. The staffing plan must be as educationally sound and in the best interest of students as the instructional/professional resources available to the building will allow. All individuals are expected to support a group decision until such time as the conditions are essentially different when the original data then may be brought up for reconsideration.

10.17 E  Music (band and choral groups) and P/S classes may be scheduled with larger class sizes as may be appropriate at the middle or high school level. Administrators at both the building and district level will review such class sizes consistent with the provisions of Article 10.19 giving consideration to the following:
i Instructional impact
ii Safety
iii Supervision
iv Scheduling
v School program
vi Class demographics
vii Other factors that may be impacted by class size.
