16.6 B ii Mileage, housing, and meals that involve travel outside of Multnomah and Clark counties

iii Payment of a substitute teacher in order to observe another classroom, or to attend approved conferences, workshops, and seminars that can only be taken during student attendance days. Such activities should occur during mid-week days when substitute demands are at lower levels.

iv Payment to oneself to attend courses and workshops that are contracted for and presented by the District. Such payment is at the approved hourly rate and may only be applied to hours outside the eight-hour weekday. Residual funds may not be used for tax purposes.

v Offsetting approved costs under a negotiation activity proposal.

16.6 C Restrictions on the use of professional development funds:

i The District will not routinely approve activities that involve absences during student attendance days. However, at the District's discretion, requests will be considered when the value of the training merits such consideration, and the training is not otherwise possible on a non-attendance day.

ii Applications should be submitted at least ten (10) working days in advance of the professional development opportunity to allow for processing and may be approved by the Human Resources Office. Applications involving travel outside of Oregon and Washington should be submitted at least thirty (30) working days in advance to allow time for Board action. Exceptions to the time may be granted at the discretion of the Human Resources Office. Professional development requests for a given school/fiscal year, must be submitted ten (10) working days prior to the last day of school or allow time to process the request and to return it to this teacher by the last day of school.

iii Requests that involve travel outside Oregon and Washington will be considered based on special circumstances and for special needs. Approval will give consideration to situations where comparable training is not available locally and in which:
  a. there are no substitutes,
  b. the employee is a national officer in the sponsoring organization,
  c. the conference is part of a larger special program or grant, or
  d. other special situations.

iv Reimbursements are subject to presentation of original receipts for all expenses. The claim for expenses should be submitted within ten (10) working days of completion of the professional development opportunity and no later than June 30 of the present school year. The District will generally process the reimbursement no later than the financial cycle following submission of a properly completed expense claim.

v Teachers are responsible for certifying professional development applications that were approved but not subsequently completed by the teacher. Because the first $725 of approved professional development is considered to be funded, any approved application for additional expenses is computed at the residual rate. Therefore, if an approved application is on file subsequent applications will be subject to residual funding rates and earlier applications are canceled or before the last day of June of the current year.
