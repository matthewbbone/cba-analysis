12.5 B Employees will be compensated at the rate of $3,068 for employees in steps 0 through 15 and $3,488 for employees at step 16 for the performance of TRI flexible responsibilities. Employees who are part time or who do not work the full school year will be compensated proportionally.

ii Certified employees who are part time or who are hired for a portion of the school year will receive a pro-rated amount of TRI flexible compensation (e.g., a .8 FTE receives 80% of the TRI flexible compensation; an employee hired on the 90th school day receives one half ($9,180) of the TRI flexible compensation. An employee's TRI flexible TRI entitlement is fixed at the end of the first year based on higher FTEs in October 1, and shall not be changed unless a new hire or his/her FTE on February 1, and will only be changed prospectively as mid-year for changes in FTE level. Employees who enter pay status after the first student day of the year, or who depart prior to the last student day of the year, are entitled to flexible TRI time for each month in which they work a majority of the scheduled work days. Unique circumstances will be referred to the Human Resources Office for resolution.

iii Employees who are on long-term, compensated leave, for twelve (12) weeks or less, will continue to receive their TRI payment providing they continue to perform TRI activities in association with the leave. In such cases, the term substitute will not receive TRI payments.

iv Employees who are on long-term, uncompensated leave, compensated leave in excess of twelve (12) weeks, or compensated leave of twelve (12) months or less but who do not continue to perform TRI activities, will not receive TRI compensation during the period of the long-term absence. Instead, TRI responsibility is transferred to a term substitute to the term substitute. The employee or term substitute who works the majority of the scheduled work days in the beginning and ending month of the long-term leave will receive the TRI compensation for that month.
