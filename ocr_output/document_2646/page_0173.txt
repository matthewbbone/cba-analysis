Recommended Process

1. To use this process to resolve a dispute, both parties must agree that:
   a) They have been unable to resolve the dispute themselves using unassisted negotiation.
   b) The dispute does not fall under any other contractual or administrative dispute resolution process.
   c) They desire to use this process.
   d) This process is an interim step to seek local resolution of the dispute through assisted negotiation.
   e) If this process is not successful in resolving the dispute, the parties do not give up any of their legal rights to take the dispute to the Public Employment Relations Commission or any other body having jurisdiction, or to pursue any other legal remedy.
   f) Information obtained during this resolution process may not be used later in a trial.

2. Once agreement to use this process is reached:
   a) The parties must agree on a neutral party to provide facilitation and mediation efforts.
   b) The neutral party will be called a mediator, but will be entitled to use all aspects of conciliation, facilitation, and mediation in attempting to assist the parties in resolving the dispute.
   c) If the parties are unable to agree initially on a mediator:
      1) Each party will prepare a list of at least three mediators acceptable to those parties.
      2) Any mediator appearing on both lists may be selected by the parties.
      3) If there are no common mediators on both lists, the lists will have to be expanded until the parties are able to agree on one.
   d) Contact with the agreed-upon mediator can be made by either party.
   e) The mediator will initially meet with the parties individually to learn their views and interests regarding the dispute.
   f) The mediator will provide ground rules to be followed by all parties during the resolution process.

3. In all of the dispute resolutions, the mediator will:
   a) Keep the process as informal as possible.
      1) No witnesses present at joint meetings.
      2) No evidence or exhibits in joint meetings.
      3) No written positions or briefs unless requested by the mediator.
   b) Help the parties define the issues and their own interests.
   c) Try to eliminate obstacles to communication between the parties.
   d) Keep confidential the information that each party shares with the mediator, and not reveal it to the other party without the consent of the party that disclosed it.
   e) Help the parties resolve their own problems:
      1) They will feel better about the solution if it were imposed by an outsider.
      2) They will take greater ownership of the decision and will support it better.
   f) Help the parties focus on the solutions that will prevent future recurrence of the problem rather than focus on punishment or revenge for an event in the past.
   g) Help the parties arrive at a proactive, win-win resolution of the dispute.
