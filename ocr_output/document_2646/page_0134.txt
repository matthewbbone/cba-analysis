CHAPTER 14. LAYOFF, LEAVE, AND RECALL PROCEDURES

Article 14.1
Purpose of layoff & recall
Prior to May 1 of each year, the Board of Directors shall determine the necessity of adopting a reduced educational program by reason of financial necessity, including, but not limited to, levy failure or decreased state support. If it is determined that such financial shortage can not be resolved for the following school year, the Board, upon recommendation of the Superintendent, may adopt a reduced educational program which shall take into consideration the provisions set forth in this Agreement. The layoff, leave, and recall procedure is to be utilized only when it is necessary to reduce the program through adjustment of certificated staff positions and the number of employees in active service.

The layoff and recall procedures are designed to effect a program and staff reduction in an orderly manner with the least hardship to individuals and with a minimum disruption of employee-employee relationships and the delivery of best possible educational services to the students of the District.

District representatives will consult with Association representatives within a reasonable time prior to or immediately following a decision to review and discuss the documents utilized in establishing the basis for anticipating a loss in revenues and consequent necessity of the decision for a reduction in program for the ensuing year. Subsequent to any final decision by the District that a reduction in program is necessary, timely, individual meetings with representatives of the Association, normally the President and Executive Director will be scheduled to ensure full communications regarding the review of budget documents.

Determination of the reduction in force shall be at the District level, not at each individual building.
