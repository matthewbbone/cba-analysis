CHAPTER 15. SITE-BASED DECISION-MAKING TEAM

Article 15.1

The VEA and VSD affirm a principle of modern management that recognizes that decisions in the operation of an organization are best made by the individuals who actually provide the service. The Site-Based Decision-Making Team philosophy is comprised of three (3) main elements:

15.1 A  The decentralization and democratization of appropriate building level decisions (i.e., those not governed by District policy, regulation, or State or Federal statute);

15.1 B  Delegation of authority to the building principal and his/her staff to identify decisions regarding the delivery of instructional programs of a school that will improve the education being provided for the students; and

15.1 C  Development of responsibility among site staff for the determination, execution, and evaluation of the revised instructional programs.

Article 15.2

The Site-Based Decision-Making Team is suitable only for topics and actions that impact instruction in a specific school which will be limited to their site. The building principal will continue to be responsible for school operations. The District will continue to determine salary, staffing formulas, testing, testing schedules, and all other such policies that ultimately impact areas not all of the various classifications of schools in the District. The Board will continue to exercise its authority and responsibilities.

Article 15.3

The parties agree that each party will equally strive in good faith to make the SBDMT philosophy a reality in all schools in the District.

Article 15.4

Site-Based Decision-Making for the purposes of this Chapter is defined as the decisions of the staff relative to the instructional program and delivery at that site.

The certificated staff shall constitute the Site-Based Decision-Making Team (SBDMT). Leadership responsibilities shall be shared by co-chairs made up of the building principal or assistant and a member of the certificated workforce. Usually (may be the same) representative who is in charge of a portion of a section of the certificated staff at that school are members of the Association's bargaining unit. Each faculty may select more than one co-chair to carry out the diverse instructional decisions within a large staff. The co-chairs will jointly establish the agendas and other aspects of governing meetings and customary duties and responsibilities of a democratic organization.
