Assault, reporting & legal

11.26 F In those situations where criminal charges arising out of employment have been filed against an employee where it is mutually determined appropriate, and there is no conflict of interest, the District agrees to reimburse all legal fees as deemed reasonable by the court to the employee if he/she is found innocent of the charges.

11.26 G Student Personal Property. Each teacher is expected to maintain a positive instructional environment in his/her classroom/activity area. In order to maintain a positive instructional environment, it may be necessary from time to time for a teacher to assume transitive possession of a student's personal property. When assuming transitive possession, the teacher shall take reasonable precautions to protect the student's personal property until it can be returned to the student. If, in the teacher's professional judgment, the teacher takes reasonable precautions to protect the student's personal property, and after consultation with the Superintendent/Designee, the District will defend the teacher from being financially liable (culpable) for the loss or damage of a student's personal property held in transitive possession. This defense is not applicable if, in the supervisor "Superintendent's" mature Superintendents' professional judgment, the teacher is negligent, or acted for convenience, or acted in malice.

The supervisor/hospital will make every reasonable effort to discourage students from bringing personal property to school that is not pertinent to their instructional needs. Each administrator/teacher shall establish procedures that teachers will follow when assuming transitive possession of student's personal property until such property is returned.

Article 11.27

11.27 A The District will utilize on behalf of part-time employees payroll deduction procedures for the purpose of making direct payment of premiums of group insurance and other programs as are mutually determined by the Association and the District. Deductions will be made according to the provisions of this Agreement and the specific instruction of each employee where such individual distinction is allowed.

District's contribution

11.27 B The District will provide the state's contribution for each calendar month for each full-time employee covered by this Agreement for the full or partial payment of the programs mutually determined by the Association and the District to be made available for employees. Part-time employees' benefits (Article 11.27 D) will be proportionate to the time served. (Specific dollar amounts are set forth in Appendix E.)

Note: Pursuant to legislation of 1990, residual amounts will first be applied to individuals within the bargaining unit pool as are required to reduce out-of-pocket payments for family medical coverage. Any remaining residual will be assigned to the self-insurance reserve (full family dental + vision + prescription + medicine, etc.).
