Derogatory materials

No evaluation, correspondence, or other material making derogatory reference to an employee's or former employee's competence, character, or manner shall be kept or placed in the personnel file without the employee's knowledge and the opportunity to attach his/her own comments or the right to have it reviewed at a fair hearing and removed if warranted.

Notification required & rebuff allowed

The grievance procedure provided in Chapter 12 of this Agreement is deemed to be the exclusive sole channel and procedure for resolution of problems arising in its interpretation and application of this Agreement.
