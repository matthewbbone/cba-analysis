16.6 C vi In the event that the District elects to cancel an employee's participation in a professional development opportunity for which the District had previously given approval to the employee, the District will reimburse the employee for any expenses, which cannot be otherwise recovered.

vi A teacher may not be reimbursed from the $725 professional development fund for both an hourly stipend and college tuition. This restriction does not apply to clock hour or college credits paid for by a block process (i.e., clock hours purchased from the ESD by the District, credits funded by grants applicable to special programs such as CEP and Title, etc.).

viii Teachers are responsible for all professional development expenses not approved by the District, or which exceed the $725 allocation (unless covered by residual funds). This restriction does not apply to professional development funded out of sources other than the $725 individual professional development fund.

ix Professional development requests that are initially disapproved by a building administrator may be appealed to the Administrator of Human Resources. The Administrator of Human Resources will consult with other appropriate staff directors and make a final decision on the request. Requests that are approved by the building administrators but disapproved by the Administrator of Human Resources may be appealed to the Superintendent who will make a final decision.

Article 16.7
Induction (training for new certificated staff)
The District will develop a specific training program (dates, topics, instructors, etc.) for all certificated staff who are new to the District in a given year.

16.7 A The Association will have the opportunity to provide input on all aspects of the training program, and the District will give full and responsive consideration to the Association's input.

16.7 B The District and the Association agree that student contact time is critical to the development and transition of new certificated staff. Therefore, the District will attempt to schedule training for non-student times (e.g., pre-school year, Saturdays, or evenings).

16.7 C Participation in new certificated staff training is mandatory. In unique or hardship situations, the District may excuse an individual from a scheduled training session, providing alternate arrangements can be made for delivery of the training.

16.7 D Certificated staff members in their first contract year with the District will be compensated for such training which occurs outside the student attendance time at the per diem rate for the first level and step of the pay schedule.

Article 16.8
Professional development program review
In the second half of each school year, the Association will have the opportunity to participate in a review of professional development program planning for the subsequent school year and to make recommendations regarding the content of the program.
