13.12 C Job Share Defined:

A job share and a part-time position are both considered fractionalized. The difference in the two (2) positions is that job shares involve two (2) persons for one (1) full-time position. A part-time position does not involve another employee in fulfilling the duties and obligations of the position. Job share teachers teach at different times of the school day or calendar days and have responsibility for the same students. Employees who are eligible for job sharing must:

i. Have continuing contract status.

ii. Currently be in the same building or have expressed an interest on the Position Interest Register for consideration in a proposed job share position.

iii. Employee Orientation

The district will provide to the employee a checklist of potential adverse effects from job sharing or otherwise accepting a part-time position and the employee willingly accepts those limitations by initialing each area.

iii.a. An individual's advancement on the salary schedule steps may be at least bimonthly and often more years apart depending on the proportion of teaching performed (Article 13.12 A ii)

iii.b. Eligibility for retirement credit may be limited or nonexistent during those years pursuant to state teachers' retirement system provisions.

iii.c. An individual's "continuing contract rights" for the following year are reduced to the proportion of the day actually worked for a following year. The District is not legally bound to reinstate the individual into a full-time position. Reinstatement to a full-time position will be at the District's convenience.

iii.d. An individual may be required to return to full time any time for "urgent needs" of the District, i.e., student enrollment change, space situations, etc.

iii.e. Individuals proposing to enter into a job sharing arrangement will prepare a signed, written agreement. It will stipulate how each individual will handle each and all of the duties and responsibilities of the position being divided. These will include, but not be limited to, the following: attendance at building and District staff meetings; in- and out-of-school activities with partners, student supervision during such duties as field trips and other school student daily activities; individual parent conferencing; equipment inventory, and similar kinds of activities normal to those of a full-time teachers may be identified by the building administrator. The building administrator will sign after reviewing and commenting in writing, either approval or disapproval of any aspect of the proposed plan. The plan is to be submitted to the Human Resources Office for a prior final review before the proposal can be approved.
