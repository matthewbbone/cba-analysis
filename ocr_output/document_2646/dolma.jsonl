SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS UNDER SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRACTS\n\nArticle 13.1\nNoncompensated but have responsibility for student activities\nAll educators, as professional staff members of a faculty, are expected to provide a certain measure of professional services that will contribute to the survival program, to the guidance program, and to the good climate and efficient operation of their school without additional compensation beyond that provided in their Basic Contract: Certificated Staff on the Professional Salary Schedule.\n\nArticle 13.2\nSupplemental contracts required.\nThe District and the Association acknowledge that state statute RCW 28A.67.074 provides that, \"No certificated employee shall be required to perform duties not described in the contract unless a new or supplemental contract is made, except that in an unexpected emergency the Board of Trustees or School District administration may require the employee to perform other reasonable duties on a temporary basis,\" and further that \"no supplemental contract shall be subject to the continuing contract provision of Title 28A or 28B.\"\n\nArticle 13.3\nSupplemental contracts issued for special assignments\n13.3 A Therefore, annually, any teacher requested to perform a duty not normally assigned to teachers will be issued a supplementary contract stipulating the duties to be performed in that special assignment and the compensation to be paid, and which the educator has agreed to accept for the coming year. The contract form is attached in Appendix D, and made a part of this Article by reference.\n\nGuidelines for selection & assignment of personnel to special activities\n13.3 B District and building administrators responsible for selecting staff for special assignments (both paid and unpaid) must make every reasonable effort to see:\n\ni That the duties of non-paid special assignments parallel the responsibilities as outlined in WAC 182-44-010\n\nii That the special assignments are equitably distributed among the staff so each faculty member carries his/her fair share. If the building principal and a majority of the teachers in a building approve, the Association faculty representative shall not be assigned such duties.\n\niii That equal opportunities are to be extended to staff to obtain compensation for special assignments requiring a teaching contract. The order of consideration for the assignment of personnel to obtain the services of the best-qualified people for paid special assignments shall be first within the building, second within the District, and third outside of the District. The Human Resources Officer shall provide the opportunity for each certificated staff member to declare higher interest in assigned duties. A list of all available positions from the District will be provided to each principal to be utilized in filling positions when an qualified certificated staff member is available from the building.\n\niv That the preferences of the certificated staff members for particular assignments are considered in making assignments.\n13.3 B v That the procedures for the selection and assignment of individuals to special assignments vacancies are made known in writing.\n\n13.3 C The District will provide Association members with the opportunity to be considered for each new assignment. The Human Resources Office will post such assignments for a period of five (5) working days and will refer available qualified candidates to the building principal either in advance or along with non-Association candidates.\n\nArticle 13.4\n\nConsideration in determining compensation for special assignments\nSpecial assignments cannot always be equal. Certain extended assignments make time demands beyond the usual requirements of all teachers. To compensate for the inherent imbalances in special assignments, factors such as these that follow will be considered in determining whether (1) compensation shall be paid and (2) the level of payment to be made for an activity. The factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance and priority:\n\n13.4 A The estimated median number of hours beyond the regular and required \"on site\" school-day hours required of all teachers and necessary for an educator to reasonably meet the demands of his/her specific special assignment, or the additional duty days beyond the basic contractual school year.\n\n13.4 B Number of teams, student participants, and adult assistants supervised.\n\n13.4 C Degree of specialized knowledge and experience necessary for the assignment.\n\n13.4 D Equipment and facilities supervision and maintenance responsibilities.\n\n13.4 E Health and safety liability factors inherent in the activity.\n\n13.4 F External public presence immediate and/or potential.\n\n13.4 G Environmental factors, out in weather, etc.\n\n13.4 H The level of payment made for a specific activity should be relevant and competitive with the \"prevailing rates of pay\" in effect for the same or similar activity in other comparable school districts.\n\nArticle 13.5\n\nRates of compensation for services provided through a supplemental contract:\n\n13.5 A Extra and Co-Curricular Programs. Services will be compensated as provided in the salary schedule of Appendix E which is made a part of this Article by reference.\n\n13.5 B The salary level indicated for each activity is based on (the level) of responsibility as identified within each of the factors in Article 13.4 through a full-scale study conducted at school year 1988-89. Should additional changes be made in the future and/or requirements change, District and the Association will promptly reevaluate the level of compensation scheduled for that activity and make whatever adjustments are necessary in compensation as are fair and equitable within that overall program.\n13.5 C Services are to be provided and salary payments will be made as are scheduled for each activity (Appendix E). The first payment for an activity should be paid at the end of the starting month, if the starting date is before the regular payroll cutoff date for that month as established by the business office.\n\n13.5 D Periodically, the District is required to mandate an employee to provide hours of services that are not and cannot be scheduled ahead of time.\ni The inventory of the loss or damages of equipment, etc.\nii To provide tutorial services to a home-bound student\niii Attendance at school board meeting or similar kind of meeting or hearing to provide a quality of information not possible to obtain from other sources.\niv School review activities and meetings and similar kinds of meetings scheduled outside normal working hours\nv Serve as an assigned mentor in formative supervision by an experienced teacher of a teacher at risk in his/her employment performance.\nvi Saturday school supervision.\nvii The presentation of planning period when substitute teachers are unavailable for absent teachers.\n\nviii. These assignments will normally be compensated at the approved hourly rate for the number of hours stipulated by the supervisor at the time the request for service is made to the employee. When assignments require the employee to provide instruction in other courses, the same type will be compensated at the approved instructional rate for that number of those assigned by the supervisor. Reimbursement for transportation costs will be allowed when needed at the established rate.\n\n13.5 E Subsidary Program Pay Rates.\ni Associated Student Body activities: Certain ASB programs require the employment of officials and others to administer their operation. The rates of pay are determined in the budget established for the ASB program. Employment of a certificated employee in these programs is optional with the employee.\n\nii Special Sport or Music Clinics, Camps, Workshops for Students. From time to time the District provides quasi-sponsorship for student activities entirely funded at the cost of the participants. Employment in these programs is optional with an employee. The level of compensation is entirely a matter to be determined by the director of each such program based on input from the employee participants and non-a certificated Association.\n\n13.5 F Categorically Funded Special Purpose Programs Rates of Pay: From time to time, the District may obtain a grant of money for a special purpose program (from the state and federal government or a foundation). The level of compensation may be stipulated within the parameters of the program as determined by the agency making the grant. When the outside agency does not establish the rate of pay, an appropriate rate established in the enhancement program will be utilized.\nArticle 13.6\nPlacement on special assignments salary schedule\nEach individual serving on a supplementary contract for compensation will be given his/her proper placement on the salary schedule adopted for that specific special assignment activity. Where incremental steps are provided, placement on the special assignments salary schedule will be based on the number of verified accesses or years in the activity at a corresponding level of responsibility for which the individual is issued a supplementary contract with the District.\n\nArticle 13.7\nGeneral supervision of extended programs & personnel\n13.7 A The extended program offered in each building will be directly administered by the building principal or a specifically designated associate principal for each extended program. Administrative responsibility will include the selection of the educator to be recommended to the Human Resources Officer to operate an extended day program, approval of hours and dates for activities, and the regular approval of the program and personnel involved in it. The building level administrator may call upon the appropriate District program supervisor to assist in/aid in carrying out administrative responsibilities.\n\nBuilding administrator's responsibilities\n13.7 B The building administrator assigned to supervise a particular paid supplementary contract assignment with each year, prior to the commencement of the activity, verbally informs the employee contracted for the activity what is expected of the employee in the assignment.\n\nArticle 13.8\nGeneral provisions of supplementary contracts: Term\n13.8 A Supplementary contracts are issued on a one-year (1) basis and expire at the end of each school year, June 30. (RCW 28A.465.240)\n\n13.8 B Payment for extended day services will normally be paid as provided in the \"Payment Schedule\" as attached in Appendix E and as revised in subsequent years.\n\nPayment schedule\n13.8 C The administrator designated to supervise a special assignment program will make every reasonable effort to meet with each supplementary contracted staff member as early as possible after the completion of a session for approval of the contract for the following school year, and an attempt will be made to continue the staff in the special assignment for the subsequent school year. Normally, the designated administrator and individual(s) serving in paid special assignments will inform the other not later than May 10 of each year if there is a reasonably strong reason or possibility that either desires to make a change in the special assignment (contractual) relationship from the previous year.\n\nMay 10 notice of recommendation and contractual status for subsequent years\n\nDates(s) of issue of supplementary contracts\n13.8 D Every reasonable effort will be made to issue paid supplementary contracts in advance of the first student attendance day of the school year. Paid supplementary contracts for special assignments will be issued as far in advance of that date when possible, all begin as is administratively feasible, i.e., conclusion of negotiations, etc.\nVoluntary nature of paid special assignment:\n13.8 E Individual educators will have the right to accept or reject the offer to provide services under a supplementary contract without fear of reprisal, e.g., poor attitude in evaluation of basic contract services, assignment to least desirable non-paid special assignments, etc. It is acknowledged by the District and Association that a qualified person must be made available in a school to serve the needs of students in the special assignment activities. The District and/or building administration may initiate transfers and/or reassignments within the district or between schools. District administrators will make other suitable arrangements to meet the needs of staffing the supplementary contract's programs. The provisions of Article 7.14 will apply in making such involuntary transfers or reassignments.\n\nDistribution of supplementary contracts:\n13.8 F Two (2) copies of each supplementary contract shall be executed with each educator assigned to an extended program, with one (1) copy to the educator and one (1) copy to the personnel file maintained for each educator in the District Human Resources Office.\n\nArticle 13.9\n\nExtended Season Compensation & Off-Site Expenses:\n\nOff-site travel and other necessary expenses incurred by an employee responsible for a student group will be reimbursed according to established District regulation for such costs.\nCHAPTER 14. LAYOFF, LEAVE, AND RECALL PROCEDURES\n\nArticle 14.1\nPurpose of layoff & recall\nPrior to May 1 of each year, the Board of Directors shall determine the necessity of adopting a reduced educational program by reason of financial necessity, including, but not limited to, levy failure or decreased state support. If it is determined that such financial shortage can not be resolved for the following school year, the Board, upon recommendation of the Superintendent, may adopt a reduced educational program which shall take into consideration the provisions set forth in this Agreement. The layoff, leave, and recall procedure is to be utilized only when it is necessary to reduce the program through adjustment of certificated staff positions and the number of employees in active service.\n\nThe layoff and recall procedures are designed to effect a program and staff reduction in an orderly manner with the least hardship to individuals and with a minimum disruption of employee-employee relationships and the delivery of best possible educational services to the students of the District.\n\nDistrict representatives will consult with Association representatives within a reasonable time prior to or immediately following a decision to review and discuss the documents utilized in establishing the basis for anticipating a loss in revenues and consequent necessity of the decision for a reduction in program for the ensuing year. Subsequent to any final decision by the District that a reduction in program is necessary, timely, individual meetings with representatives of the Association, normally the President and Executive Director will be scheduled to ensure full communications regarding the review of budget documents.\n\nDetermination of the reduction in force shall be at the District level, not at each individual building.\n\nArticle 14.2\nBoard's responsibility\n14.2 A Priority shall be given to retention of positions in those programs and services in those areas which relate to instruction and safety of students.\n14.2 B The District has the legal responsibility to establish the educational programs, services, and staffing patterns in accordance with the District's basic educational goals and program continuity, consistent with the financial resources available. The District has the authority to make necessary adjustments in the District's educational programs, services, and other responsibilities as defined in statute.\n\nArticle 14.3\nPrecipitating conditions\nConditions which may cause utilization of the layoff and recall procedure are:\n14.3 A Failure of a special levy election or other events resulting in a significant reduction in anticipated revenues from any source for a following school year.\n14.3 B Termination or reduction by state and national sources of categorically funded projects.\n14.3 C A student enrollment decline requiring a proportionate staff reduction.\nArticle 14-4\nReduction of expenditures\nThe District will reasonably attempt to minimize the number of positions to be abolished by reducing expenditures in areas of capital outlay, travel, contractual services, cash reserves, books, and supplies.\n\nArticle 14.5\nEmployment classifications, categories & specialties\nThe following general classifications and specific categories and specialization in certified positions within each are established to ensure the qualification of personnel assigned to retained positions for the reduced and remaining programs and for the purposes of this Chapter.\n14.5 A Elementary classroom teachers, K-5, with K-8 endorsements and other teachers who possess the Washington State Standard/Continuing Teaching Certificate.\n\n14.5 B Middle school classroom teachers, 6-8, with K-8 endorsements, and other teachers who possess secondary endorsements necessary to teach specialty areas at the middle school level (e.g., language arts, English, social studies, science, mathematics, physical education, etc.), including those individuals who possess the Washington State Standard/Continuing Teaching Certificate.\n\n14.5 C High school classroom teachers, 9-12, who possess secondary endorsements necessary to teach specialty areas at the high school level (e.g., language arts, English, social studies, science, mathematics, physical education, etc.), including those individuals who possess the Washington State Standard/Continuing Teaching Certificate.\n\n14.5 D Other non-supervisory certified positions:\ni Specialist by field of specialty, (e.g., art, music, dance, reading, etc.)\nii Special education personnel (by field of specialty)\niii Vocational teachers (by field of specialty)\niv Nurses\nv Psychologists\nvi Other educational staff associates (e.g., SLP, OT, PT, etc.)\nvii Secondary counselors\nviii Elementary counselors\nix Elementary media specialists\nx Secondary media specialists\n\n(Staff members who, by part-time assignments, have accumulated the equivalent of one (1) year of full-time experience in an additional position classification satisfy the requirement of this paragraph with respect to an additional position classification.)\nArticle 14.6\n\n14.6 A Each certificated staff member who possesses either an initial or continuing teaching certificate will, in accordance with higher seniority, be considered for retention in his/her position and vacancies of the same kind in the class/section, category, or specialty position based upon the individual's certified endorsement(s) as registered in the Human Resources Office.\n\n14.6 B A certificated staff member who possesses the standard teaching certificate will, in accordance with higher seniority, be considered for retention in his/her position and vacancies of the same kind based upon the following criteria:\n\ni.

Successful experience in teaching subjects outside the major/minor of preparation within the last ten (10) years.\n\nv. The classification, categories, and/or specialties he/she is qualified for as per Article 14.5 and other order of preference for each in addition to the present assignment.\n14.6 D Staff members will be considered for additional classifications, categories, and/or specialties only if they do not qualify for retention in the classification, category, or specialty position held at the time of implementation of these procedures.\n\nArticle 14.7\n\nCertificated staff members shall be considered for retention or recall to vacancies in positions within the classifications, categories, or specialties for which they qualify under Article 14.6 hereof. The individual must possess a valid Washington State Certificate authorizing service in any position for which he/she is being considered or assigned. In the event that there are more qualified employees than available positions in a given classification, category, or specialty, the following criteria shall be used to determine the order of retention and recommendation for reassignment or recall from the employment pool.\n\nSeniority consideration\n\n14.7 A Total seniority as a certificated staff member shall be the basis for retention and recall in classifications in those categories and specialties identified in Article 14.5 above.\n\nWithin each such classification, category, or specialty, the staff member(s) having the greater seniority shall be recommended for retention.\n\nSeniority defined\n\nSeniority for the purposes of this Chapter should mean the total number of years an employee has served in a position with the District and/or other school districts within the state of Washington as defined in RCW 28A.400.305. The traditional nine (9) month academic year shall be considered a 1.0 school year. Part-time (partial year or day) service under a regular contract will be proportionately computed in terms of (1/9ths) of the basic school year (180 days, eight hours, 7.5 hours). However, no employee with less than one (1) school year shall be counted for seniority (12 month period). All experience to be considered for seniority must have been documented by February 1 and claimed on or before February 15 of each year (see Article 14.6 C). Professional education experience shall mean total years of experience eligible for submission to OESPT on the annual personnel report (3-275). (See Articles 11.11, 11.12, and 11.18.)\n\nTotal number of years, seniority consideration\n\n14.7 B In the event equal seniority exists among two (2) or more staff members qualified for a position to be retained, the staff member having the highest number of credits shall be assigned to the position retained.\n\nDrawing lots in \"ties\"\n\n14.7 C In the event a tie exists in both total years of seniority and total number of credits, the tie will be broken by drawing lots among the staff members in the tie.\n\nAssoc. Pres. super-seniority\n\n14.7 D The president of the Association for the year of the reduced program shall be equal in seniority to the most senior certificated employee in the District.\n\nSecondary consideration assignment, seniority computation\n\n14.7 E A secondary counselor will be assigned to a retained secondary counseling position on the basis of higher total seniority of service as secondary counseling. For purposes of this paragraph, staff member has performed in the secondary counseling area (as defined in PTE) or has been an assistant teacher and granted the devotion to secondary counseling for at least one semester in any given year.\nObjective required in definitions\n\n14.7 F The layoff and recall procedure will not be used to separate an individual from active service whose performance is rated \"satisfactory\" according to the procedures established in Chapter 8 of this Agreement. Any separation for less than satisfactory service will be accomplished according to the provisions of that Chapter.\n\nArticle 14.8\n\nDetermination of vacant positions\n\nThe District will determine, as accurately as possible, the total number of certificated staff members known as of May 1 who are leaving active service in the District for reasons of retirement, family transfer, normal resignations, leaves, discharges, or nonrenewals, etc., and these separations will be taken into consideration in determining the number of available certificated positions being retained for the following school year.\n\nVacant positions will be filled by transferring currently employed staff members within the District unless, by reason of certification, training, and/or experience, no qualified person is available\n\nArticle 14.9\n\nInstitution of layoff & recall procedure\n\n14.9 A On or before May 1, the District will determine the program to be carried out during the year of anticipated reduced funding, and the probable number of positions in each classification to be retained and probable number of positions in each classification to be abolished.

Article 6.13 of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement will govern the application and implementation of those people placed in the District employment pool. Reference is hereby made to Article 6.13 and by this reference made a part of this Article. The District will publish and adhere to reasonable and prudent procedures for notice, an individual in the pool when vacancies occur for which he/she is qualified.\n\nArticle 14.14\nAffirmative Action\nIf the layoff or recall can be accomplished under the normal procedures set forth above without causing or aggravating an imbalance on the certified staff's ethnic and/or male/female representation within any of the two (2) employment areas as defined below, the standard procedures shall remain and the special provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.\n14.14.8 If the layoff and recall under the normal procedures would result in causing or aggravating an imbalance in the certificated staff's ethnic and/or male/female representation within a given employment area, then such layoff and recall shall be accomplished by applying to each group represented by numbers that are less than those represented by the group(s) represented by numbers that are greater. If the number of persons within the underrepresented group is reduced by more than 10% (as closely as may be practicable), the number of persons within the area as a whole is reduced. The layoff and recall within each underrepresented group shall be accomplished by applying to the members of the underrepresented group based on normal selection rules set forth above.\nCHAPTER 15. SITE-BASED DECISION-MAKING TEAM\n\nArticle 15.1\n\nThe VEA and VSD affirm a principle of modern management that recognizes that decisions in the operation of an organization are best made by the individuals who actually provide the service. The Site-Based Decision-Making Team philosophy is comprised of three (3) main elements:\n\n15.1 A  The decentralization and democratization of appropriate building level decisions (i.e., those not governed by District policy, regulation, or State or Federal statute);\n\n15.1 B  Delegation of authority to the building principal and his/her staff to identify decisions regarding the delivery of instructional programs of a school that will improve the education being provided for the students; and\n\n15.1 C  Development of responsibility among site staff for the determination, execution, and evaluation of the revised instructional programs.\n\nArticle 15.2\n\nThe Site-Based Decision-Making Team is suitable only for topics and actions that impact instruction in a specific school which will be limited to their site. The building principal will continue to be responsible for school operations. The District will continue to determine salary, staffing formulas, testing, testing schedules, and all other such policies that ultimately impact areas not all of the various classifications of schools in the District. The Board will continue to exercise its authority and responsibilities.\n\nArticle 15.3\n\nThe parties agree that each party will equally strive in good faith to make the SBDMT philosophy a reality in all schools in the District.\n\nArticle 15.4\n\nSite-Based Decision-Making for the purposes of this Chapter is defined as the decisions of the staff relative to the instructional program and delivery at that site.\n\nThe certificated staff shall constitute the Site-Based Decision-Making Team (SBDMT). Leadership responsibilities shall be shared by co-chairs made up of the building principal or assistant and a member of the certificated workforce. Usually (may be the same) representative who is in charge of a portion of a section of the certificated staff at that school are members of the Association's bargaining unit. Each faculty may select more than one co-chair to carry out the diverse instructional decisions within a large staff. The co-chairs will jointly establish the agendas and other aspects of governing meetings and customary duties and responsibilities of a democratic organization.\nArticle 15.3\n\nEach SBDMT will be comprised of two (2) kinds of members:\n\nActive\nAn active member is an individual who personally chooses to become involved in all of the processes necessary in the study and planning as well as the implementation aspects of all the activities involved in the identification and achievement of an instructional goal. These persons are willing to remain on site beyond the routine \"on-site\" seven and one-half hour (7 1/2) day, to advise the management/leadership program, following approved program guidelines. Active members have by self-determination and declaration identified themselves as active participants.\n\nThe principal and co-chairs will organize these persons into committees, the number and size of committees as is appropriate to meet the needs of the instructional issues of the site they serve. The name, time, and place of meetings shall be determined mainly by the co-chair or chair for each committee. Every reasonable effort will be made to provide equitable opportunity for involvement of each member of the group. Sub-committee chairs will schedule meetings as mutually determined by members of the committees. Disputes over whether a proposed decision is subject to site-based decision-making will be referred to the Association and the District for resolution.\n\nPassive\nA passive member is an individual who chooses to play no significant role in the study and planning of a school improvement planning process. Passive members shall be included in the review of proposed plans and in all consensus building activities relative to the approval and implementation of the plan.\n\nArticle 15.6\n\nLevels of agreement\nThe decision-making process shall include open dialogue in which issues are presented, defined, discussed, and resolved. This shall be a process in which those affected by a decision participate directly or through a representative process. The following levels of agreement are in the order of priority:\n\nConsensus\n15.6 A Every reasonable effort will be made to reach instructional decisions of the team by consensus. Consensus is when a decision has been agreed to by all members, active and passive. All members have an understanding of the reasoning leading to the decision and will support the decision. Example: Five-to-five method, all participants show five's. This would be the same as a 100% agreement.\n\nSufficient consensus\n15.6 B Each member, active and passive, may not completely agree with the decision, but shall feel that they have had their information and opinions heard, that their views have been considered, and that now all will abide by the group decision and support its implementation. Example: Four-to-five method, participants range in agreement from 1-5, but no fives are indicated.\n\nVoting\n15.6 C When it has been determined by the co-chairs that consensus cannot be achieved, proposals may be submitted for a vote to only those members of the faculty who are impacted by the vote. The rationale regarding who should have voting rights and who will not is established by the decision team. The issue will be referred to the co-chairs and VBA building representatives for resolution by consensus. When votes are taken, 100% approval is required by all sites. Each Site-Based Decision-Making Team may increase the percentage necessary for approval due to its unique\ncircumstances of the proposal. The vote to determine a higher rate of approval shall be based on a simple majority. The decision regarding ballot procedures shall be exclusive to each site or administrative unit. The VEA building representative(s) shall be responsible for all balloting.\n\nArticle 15.7\n\nMinority reports\nAny member of the Site-Based Decision-Making Team shall have the right to make a minority report to the team. Sufficient time shall be granted for the member to compose and present his/her report prior to any approval process.\n\nArticle 15.8\n\nAgendas and Minutes\nThe principal and balloter team will determine the mechanism for determining the meeting agenda. The principal will ensure that every notice of topics discussed and action taken at the meetings. The principal will see that any recommendations and/or decisions are prepared for publication and distribution made to all members of the team in a timely manner.\n\nArticle 15.9\n\nUse of TRI funds\nDecision making activities may require additional time beyond regularly scheduled faculty meetings. Consequently, all Flexible Days available to each SBT may be used by members for instructional program planning beyond the regularly scheduled school day, and one hundred eighty (180) day school year.\n\nArticle 15.10\n\nBudget oversight committee\nEach school, site, or administrative unit shall form a mandatory budget oversight committee. The makeup of this committee shall be the principal/designee, co-chair(s), VEA faculty representative(s), secretary or clerk responsible for budgets, representatives from departments with specialties, and any other individuals necessary to the functioning of the budget oversight committee. The function will be to oversee the planning and distribution of the budget and to monitor at least once a month all expenditures, balances, transfers, etc. Full disclosure of budget information shall be available to each faculty member by the members of the budget oversight committee.\n\n***All references to SBMT contained in other chapters of the CPA shall be considered SBDMT pursuant to this revision of Chapter 15.\nCHAPTER 16 - PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nArticle 16.1\nProfessional development\nGeneral Administration of the Professional Development Funds.\n\nConcept\n16.1 A The District and the Association recognize the imperative that teachers and educational support personnel be life-long learners. To meet this need, each employee must have access to a continuous cycle of professional development, strategically planned to enhance subject matter knowledge, essential learnings, pedagogical practices, personal and professional growth, continuous certification, and District goals and priorities.\n\n16.1 B A continuous cycle of professional development will begin with the employee's self-assessment. Professional development needs identified through this process will be reviewed by the employee's supervisor and form the basis for a plan tailored to individual needs and goals. Individual professional development needs will be made available to the Human Resources Office. The Human Resources Office will use the information so sent in identifying specific opportunities to satisfy the needs of all employees within District, and to determine whether the plans conform with the District's professional development guidelines. Funding of professional development needs may, consistent with Article 16.4 B and 16.5, be from the employee's individual professional development funds, or from other funds made available by the District.\n\nArticle 16.2\nOptional Professional Development Funds \u2013 Appendix E\n\n16.2 A The District will allocate $725 for professional development activities for each FTE. This amount, subject to the availability of funds, is in addition to funding for other TRL categories listed above.\n\n16.2 B Professional development funds will be made available to assist each employee in professional growth activities, such as but not limited to the following:\n\ni Unique individual development needs by the selection of specific course work, attendance at workshops, conferences, and/or,\n\nii By obtaining training/instruction on a specific instructional skill or knowledge of a curriculum area through merging of other funds with either employee's funds in order to provide for a building staff cooperative workshop.\n\n16.2 C The District will provide the Association with an annual written program performance report summarizing the professional development fund to include total participants, residual funding percentage, and amount of funds remaining (if any) after the residual pay out.\n\n16.2 D The program year for professional development is July 1 \u2013 June 30. The District will provide written notice to all certificated employees that claims for professional development that will be completed by June 30 are to be submitted by July 10 for payment against the $725 entitlement and any residual amount.\nArticle 16.3\n\nCourses/Seminars Applicable To Extended Day Activities:\n\n16.3 A Directors and advisors assigned to extended day activities may apply for professional development funding of courses and seminars or studies related to their extended day assignment listed in Appendix B. Approval by the employee's immediate supervisor and the Superintendent/designee will be conditional on whether the requesting staff member has, in the judgment of the District, met his/her professional growth obligation relative to his/her present assignment for the current school year.\n\n16.3 B Funding for a course or seminar is further restricted as follows:\n  i. A maximum reimbursement of $725 is imposed.\n  ii. Attendance at one course or seminar per year (July 1 \u2013 June 30) shall be reimbursed.\n  iii. Travel to a course or seminar is restricted within the states of Washington and Oregon.\n  iv. Attendance at a course or seminar is limited to after the employee's work day and non-duty days.\n\nArticle 16.4\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n16.4 A The Board of Directors will continue to hold the right and responsibility to exercise full control over the formulation of basic policy decisions that pertain to the study, maintenance, and instruction in all curriculum and instructional matters, including the plan for staff in-service development goals and programs of the District. The District and its Association also recognize that changes in student enrollment patterns and the community's expectations for alterations in the kind and quality of the educational programs will require the acquisition of new knowledge and skills by the teaching staff and by their certificated support staff.\n\n16.4 B Because the Individually Designed Professional Development Program receives tax-free status, it is important that certain guidelines and restrictions are adhered to in order to maintain such status.\n  i. Individuals must pay for their participation and be reimbursed after completion.\n  ii. Verification of participation must be submitted and maintained.\n  iii. Individuals may only utilize funds in such a way as to receive direct benefit.\n  iv. Funds cannot be donated to another individual, for participation.\n\n16.4 C The District will make every reasonable effort to identify in official publications the areas of the District's curriculum and instructional program that will receive new knowledge and skills, and positions where personnel shortages are contemplated. This information will assist an individual in formulating his/her individual professional development proposal for presentation to his/her evaluator and the Superintendent/designee.\n\nArticle 16.5\n\nBasic understanding\n\n16.5 A The parties agree that in addition to career growth, and new and emerging skills and knowledge, the professional development program should also support:\n  i. Retaining of currently employed staff to enable them to continue employment with the District if a program is being phased out and/or a teacher is working outside his/her area of academic preparation.\nii. Updating teachers to provide effective service to students in the present or in a revised curriculum program as may be adopted by the District.\n\niii. Maintaining certification.\n\nTeacher assistance\n\n16.5 B An individual may be required to participate in a particular professional development opportunity if there is abundant evidence that such involvement is critical to improvement of the professional performance of his/her current assignment and/or s/he is placed on formal probation or at \"high risk\" for probation. These costs may be charged to the individual professional development funds.\n\nMandatory Training\n\n16.5 C The District may direct up to sixteen (16) hours per year of professional development training for which the employee will be reimbursed at the approved hourly rate from the $725 annual fund. Such mandatory training will be communicated not later than the close of the previous school year by the appropriate official and must fix their remaining expenses. Any additional mandatory training will be subject to approval of other officials and would be scheduled in consultation with the Association and with alternative provisions to accommodate employees who cannot attend at the scheduled time.\n\nArticle 16.6\n\nIndividual professional development funds\n\nThe District will allocate individual professional development funds in the described amounts. Certified employees may participate on a voluntary basis, and may access these funds in accordance with the provisions in this chapter.\n\n16.6 A Reimbursement levels:\n\ni. Each full-time teacher on provisional or continuing contract may receive up to $725 of professional development funds per school year. These teachers are also eligible to be reimbursed for expenses beyond $725, but not to exceed $1,000 from any residual funds, on an application after the last day of June. Such residual funds will be distributed proportionately after the initial claims and payment process with no teacher over the base of $725 restricted to district-approved college and university programs and coursework. An exception to the use of residual funds for reimbursement of workshops and conferences may be made for education staff associates who require such professional development (i.e., out of state travel) for required re-certification, which cannot be obtained through any other means. The District will pay a percentage based on total residual funds relative to total approved expenses beyond $725. The District will have the discretion to make payouts beyond the $1,000 limit when residual funds are available.\n\nii. Part-time teachers, and full-time teachers who have not worked the full year, may receive an amount equal to their FTE percentage (e.g., a half-time teacher, or a full-time teacher hired at midyear, may receive $362.50 of the basic amount and 50 percent of any authorized residual amount.)\n\niii. Teachers on one-year appointments may receive up to $725 for activities taken and completed by the last student day of the school year.\n\niv. Teachers employed less than 0.4 FTE, and teachers on terminable substitute appointments, do not receive professional development funds.\n\n16.6 B Expenses which qualify for reimbursement include:\n\ni. Registration fees, credit fees, textbooks, and materials for approved courses, workshops, conferences, and seminars.\n16.6 B ii Mileage, housing, and meals that involve travel outside of Multnomah and Clark counties\n\niii Payment of a substitute teacher in order to observe another classroom, or to attend approved conferences, workshops, and seminars that can only be taken during student attendance days. Such activities should occur during mid-week days when substitute demands are at lower levels.\n\niv Payment to oneself to attend courses and workshops that are contracted for and presented by the District. Such payment is at the approved hourly rate and may only be applied to hours outside the eight-hour weekday. Residual funds may not be used for tax purposes.\n\nv Offsetting approved costs under a negotiation activity proposal.\n\n16.6 C Restrictions on the use of professional development funds:\n\ni The District will not routinely approve activities that involve absences during student attendance days. However, at the District's discretion, requests will be considered when the value of the training merits such consideration, and the training is not otherwise possible on a non-attendance day.\n\nii Applications should be submitted at least ten (10) working days in advance of the professional development opportunity to allow for processing and may be approved by the Human Resources Office. Applications involving travel outside of Oregon and Washington should be submitted at least thirty (30) working days in advance to allow time for Board action. Exceptions to the time may be granted at the discretion of the Human Resources Office. Professional development requests for a given school/fiscal year, must be submitted ten (10) working days prior to the last day of school or allow time to process the request and to return it to this teacher by the last day of school.\n\niii Requests that involve travel outside Oregon and Washington will be considered based on special circumstances and for special needs. Approval will give consideration to situations where comparable training is not available locally and in which:\n  a. there are no substitutes,\n  b. the employee is a national officer in the sponsoring organization,\n  c. the conference is part of a larger special program or grant, or\n  d. other special situations.\n\niv Reimbursements are subject to presentation of original receipts for all expenses. The claim for expenses should be submitted within ten (10) working days of completion of the professional development opportunity and no later than June 30 of the present school year. The District will generally process the reimbursement no later than the financial cycle following submission of a properly completed expense claim.\n\nv Teachers are responsible for certifying professional development applications that were approved but not subsequently completed by the teacher. Because the first $725 of approved professional development is considered to be funded, any approved application for additional expenses is computed at the residual rate. Therefore, if an approved application is on file subsequent applications will be subject to residual funding rates and earlier applications are canceled or before the last day of June of the current year.\n16.6 C vi In the event that the District elects to cancel an employee's participation in a professional development opportunity for which the District had previously given approval to the employee, the District will reimburse the employee for any expenses, which cannot be otherwise recovered.\n\nvi A teacher may not be reimbursed from the $725 professional development fund for both an hourly stipend and college tuition. This restriction does not apply to clock hour or college credits paid for by a block process (i.e., clock hours purchased from the ESD by the District, credits funded by grants applicable to special programs such as CEP and Title, etc.).\n\nviii Teachers are responsible for all professional development expenses not approved by the District, or which exceed the $725 allocation (unless covered by residual funds). This restriction does not apply to professional development funded out of sources other than the $725 individual professional development fund.\n\nix Professional development requests that are initially disapproved by a building administrator may be appealed to the Administrator of Human Resources. The Administrator of Human Resources will consult with other appropriate staff directors and make a final decision on the request. Requests that are approved by the building administrators but disapproved by the Administrator of Human Resources may be appealed to the Superintendent who will make a final decision.\n\nArticle 16.7\nInduction (training for new certificated staff)\nThe District will develop a specific training program (dates, topics, instructors, etc.) for all certificated staff who are new to the District in a given year.\n\n16.7 A The Association will have the opportunity to provide input on all aspects of the training program, and the District will give full and responsive consideration to the Association's input.\n\n16.7 B The District and the Association agree that student contact time is critical to the development and transition of new certificated staff. Therefore, the District will attempt to schedule training for non-student times (e.g., pre-school year, Saturdays, or evenings).\n\n16.7 C Participation in new certificated staff training is mandatory. In unique or hardship situations, the District may excuse an individual from a scheduled training session, providing alternate arrangements can be made for delivery of the training.\n\n16.7 D Certificated staff members in their first contract year with the District will be compensated for such training which occurs outside the student attendance time at the per diem rate for the first level and step of the pay schedule.\n\nArticle 16.8\nProfessional development program review\nIn the second half of each school year, the Association will have the opportunity to participate in a review of professional development program planning for the subsequent school year and to make recommendations regarding the content of the program.\n\nVancouver School District No. 37\nCertificated Employee \u2013 Basic Contract\n\nName:\nSSN:\nDate:\nLocation:\n\nComments:\n\n1.

In carrying out their joint mission, there are occasions when disagreements arise. The Comprehensive Professional Agreement provides a grievance procedure for resolving disagreements regarding matters covered by the Agreement including:\n\n1) Interpretation or application of the terms of a regulation, rule, or practice;\n2) Inequitable treatment of an employee;\n3) Existence of a condition that jeopardizes employees health or safety.\n\nThe District also has regular administrative channels that Association members may use for resolving certain other disagreements.\n\nHowever, both the District and the Association have recently realized that disputes may arise that fall outside the Agreement and are not sufficiently covered by other resolution processes. It is their desire to develop an efficient and cost-effective process for jointly attempting to resolve these disputes locally, while still protecting their rights to take the dispute to the Public Employment Relations Commission, or to any other body having jurisdiction, if the local process is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute. The report analyzes all of the options and recommends such a process.\n\nRecommendation: In reviewing the available options, assisted negotiation using a neutral third party acceptable to both sides seems to be the best choice for all disputes, regardless of the subject and regardless of the settlement attempts up to that point. Assisted negotiation involves the parties in solving their own dispute, is less formal and less costly, and is generally better accepted than a decision rendered by an outside third party. The recommended process is explained in detail in the Recommended Process section of this appendix.\n\nThe recommendation protects the rights of the parties to refer the dispute to other authorities if this local resolution process is unsuccessful. It also provides that the parties may mutually agree to stop the process at any point, but may not unilaterally proceed to the next legal option without first exhausting all efforts in assisted negotiation.\n\nThe recommendation recognizes that the District and the Association are long-term partners in the provision of quality education, and that they need a flexible process to resolve disputes falling outside of the Agreement and the administrative processes. It provides an amicable dispute resolution process that is critical to the parties' long-term relationship. It also recognizes that no two disputes are the same, and that it is important to make every effort to help the parties reach their own solution and to keep the process as informal as possible.\n\nThe process might also be appropriate for either party to use in resolving other disputes.\nRecommended Process\n\n1. To use this process to resolve a dispute, both parties must agree that:\n   a) They have been unable to resolve the dispute themselves using unassisted negotiation.\n   b) The dispute does not fall under any other contractual or administrative dispute resolution process.\n   c) They desire to use this process.\n   d) This process is an interim step to seek local resolution of the dispute through assisted negotiation.\n   e) If this process is not successful in resolving the dispute, the parties do not give up any of their legal rights to take the dispute to the Public Employment Relations Commission or any other body having jurisdiction, or to pursue any other legal remedy.\n   f) Information obtained during this resolution process may not be used later in a trial.\n\n2. Once agreement to use this process is reached:\n   a) The parties must agree on a neutral party to provide facilitation and mediation efforts.\n   b) The neutral party will be called a mediator, but will be entitled to use all aspects of conciliation, facilitation, and mediation in attempting to assist the parties in resolving the dispute.\n   c) If the parties are unable to agree initially on a mediator:\n      1) Each party will prepare a list of at least three mediators acceptable to those parties.\n      2) Any mediator appearing on both lists may be selected by the parties.\n      3) If there are no common mediators on both lists, the lists will have to be expanded until the parties are able to agree on one.\n   d) Contact with the agreed-upon mediator can be made by either party.\n   e) The mediator will initially meet with the parties individually to learn their views and interests regarding the dispute.\n   f) The mediator will provide ground rules to be followed by all parties during the resolution process.\n\n3. In all of the dispute resolutions, the mediator will:\n   a) Keep the process as informal as possible.\n      1) No witnesses present at joint meetings.\n      2) No evidence or exhibits in joint meetings.\n      3) No written positions or briefs unless requested by the mediator.\n   b) Help the parties define the issues and their own interests.\n   c) Try to eliminate obstacles to communication between the parties.\n   d) Keep confidential the information that each party shares with the mediator, and not reveal it to the other party without the consent of the party that disclosed it.\n   e) Help the parties resolve their own problems:\n      1) They will feel better about the solution if it were imposed by an outsider.\n      2) They will take greater ownership of the decision and will support it better.\n   f) Help the parties focus on the solutions that will prevent future recurrence of the problem rather than focus on punishment or revenge for an event in the past.\n   g) Help the parties arrive at a proactive, win-win resolution of the dispute.\n4. The parties should agree on time frames for resolution of the dispute:\n   a) If the parties cannot agree, the recommendation of the mediator will be used.\n   b) The parties jointly, or the mediator, have the flexibility to adjust the time frames if progress warrants it.\n\n5. The mediator will use conciliation, facilitation, and mediation in attempting to help the parties resolve the dispute:\n   a) The mediator will meet with the parties individually and together as progress warrants.\n   b) The mediator will advise the parties honestly and make suggestions as appropriate to assist in the resolution process.\n   c) The mediator may consult with outside experts in the subject area of the dispute and may call in an outside expert to assist the process with neutral evaluation or fact finding.\n   d) If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the mediator may:\n      1) Privately analyze with each party the strengths and weaknesses of its case.\n      2) Recommend a solution and work to move the parties toward acceptance of the solution, but the recommendation is not binding on the parties.\n   e) Negotiations will continue until the dispute is resolved or until all parties agree that further negotiations are fruitless.\n\n6. If the parties reach agreement, they must also agree on whether the decision is precedent setting for all similar future disputes, or is a one-time solution.\n\n7. If appropriate, the agreement may include provisions for monitoring the progress of the solution over time, with the mediator acting as the monitor at agreed upon intervals and reporting back to the parties. If the mediator finds the solution is not working, he or she may recommend to the parties that they reconvene and attempt to improve the solution.\n\n8. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute despite the best efforts of assisted negotiation, the mediator will discuss with both parties the ramifications of not reaching agreement and the options available to them to resolve the dispute.\n\n9. The parties may mutually agree to stop this process at any point, but they may not unilaterally stop the process and move directly to the Public Employment Relations Commission, or any other outside body, without first exhausting all efforts in assisted negotiation.\n\n10. Both parties will bear their own costs through all steps of the process and will share equally in the cost of the mediator and all outside costs of the resolution process.\nTypes of Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\nUnassisted Negotiation: Unassisted negotiation involves only the people embroiled in the dispute and no third parties. There are two types:\n\n1. Competitive:\nNegotiators seek to maximize their own gain at the expense of the other party;\nMost effective for one-shot, single issue situations in which there will be no long-term relationship.\n\n2. Collaborative:\nNegotiators seek to find solutions that satisfy everyone's interest;\nSearch for joint gains rather than compromising or splitting the difference;\nAppropriate where creative solutions are possible;\nBest where parties will have ongoing relationship;\nBuilds trust and credibility.\n\nAssisted Negotiations: These are attempts to encourage and assist the parties to jointly develop their own solution to the dispute. These processes have been shown to be favored by most parties because the parties are involved in developing their own solution, they take greater ownership of the solution than one prescribed by a third party, and the process is generally less formal and less costly than other processes.\n\nConciliation/Convening:\nConciliator acts as:\n  Bring the parties together;\n  Carry messages between parties;\n  Provide diplomacy and expedite the process.\n\nFacilitation:\nFacilitator does everything the Conciliator does, plus:\n  Acts as moderator;\n  Makes certain all parties are heard.\nFacilitator does not:\n  Volunteer own ideas;\n  Actively participate in moving parties toward agreement.\n\nMediation:\nMediator does everything the Facilitator does, plus:\n  Helps parties to reach their own settlement;\n  Meets with both parties separately and together;\n  Helps the parties focus on remedies for the future rather than responsibility for the past.\n  Does not judge right or wrong, guilt or innocence.\n\nNegotiated Rule Making:\nMediator invites representatives of competing interest groups to participate in mediation to reach agreement on new rules or regulations.\nOutcome Prediction: If agreement cannot be reached using assisted negotiation, the next best step may be some form of outcome prediction. These processes are attempts to show the parties what might happen if negotiations fail and the parties proceed to litigation. They are generally used to encourage the parties to continue attempting to reach a negotiated settlement and avoid litigation.\n\nNeutral Evaluation:\nNeutral third party, who is knowledgeable in the substantive area of the dispute, listens to the facts and legal arguments and attempts to predict the probable range of outcomes before the parties go to more formal proceedings.\n\nFact Findings:\nNeutral third party gives the disputants or the decision-maker findings of fact, possibly with a recommended solution.\nSimilar to non-binding arbitration.\n\nOmbuds and Complaint Programs:\nSupposedly independent person who investigates problems and complaints and attempts to resolve them through mediation or recommended solutions.\nGenerally seen in government and corporate organizations.\n\nMini-trial:\nMeetings chaired by neutral advisor.\nLawyers present summaries of their cases to chief executives or decision makers representing both sides.\nChief executives or decision makers attempt to settle the case.\nIf they are unable to reach agreement, the neutral advisor may mediate or recommend a settlement.\n\nSummary Jury Trials\nInvolves a judge and summary jury participating in an abbreviated hearing and rendering a non-binding verdict, explaining it to participants and answering questions.\nAttempts to predict the outcome of a full trial.\n\nNon-binding Arbitration:\nGenerally part of the litigation process, just before going to trial.\nAttempts to settle smaller civil litigation cases.\nArbitrator's decision is non-binding and case can proceed to court if not settled by the parties.\n\nMediation/Arbitration:\nNeutral third party mediates, but if the parties are unable to reach a settlement, will act as arbitrator and impose a decision.\nMediator is not supposed to use any confidential information obtained during mediation in deciding the arbitration.\nAdjudication: If outcome prediction does not result in a negotiated settlement, the remaining processes involve placing the matter completely in the hands of a third party who will render a binding decision on the parties. These processes generally require more time and effort, and are generally more costly than the processes in which the parties attempt to resolve their own dispute. Therefore, parties should make every effort to use assisted negotiation and outcome prediction before placing the dispute entirely in the hands of a third party for a decision.\n\nArbitration:\nNeutral third party listens to both parties and renders a binding decision.\nGenerally follows more formal processes than assisted negotiation.\n\nCourtroom Arbitration:\nArbitration involving the use of a private court and judge who listens to both parties and renders a binding decision.\n\nLitigation:\nBinding decision rendered by a judge or jury.\nFormal, lengthy, and expensive.\n\nArticles in CPA Dealing with Dispute Resolution\n\nThe Comprehensive Professional Agreement articles listed below deal with dispute resolution and may or may
