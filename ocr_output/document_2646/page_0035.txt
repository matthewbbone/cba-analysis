(6.2 E) Employees in their first year in the District, and others without an accumulation of sick leave days, may be advanced up to twelve (12) sick leave days in a school year not yet earned to be utilized as needed—The number of days to be advanced is subject to review by the Human Comprehensive Professional Agreement entitlement. Advanced leave will be immediately offset against future accrual until such time as it is paid back. If the employee leaves District employment prior to earning such advanced leave, the cost of any taxes but incurred leave will be offset against final compensation due. Advanced leave which is neither earned nor offset against compensation will be subject to an individualized decision to pursue collection of the amount in accordance with determination that sufficient circumstances exist to warrant forgiveness of the incurred amount (e.g., serious illness and or death).
