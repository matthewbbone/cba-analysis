11.26 D ix Reimbursement of employee claims will occur in June. The amount of reimbursement, up to a maximum of $5500, depends on the number of claims filed with the District. The District will make every effort to see that each employee receives an equitable share of the $5000. For example: If there were forty (40) claims for $250, each employee would receive $125.

Industrial accident 11.26 E i It is recognized that the payments received as compensation by an employee injured on the job under circumstances bringing him/her within the coverage of the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state of Washington are less than the regular wage payments received by the employee.

ii In case of any on-the-job disability which is covered by State Industrial Insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state of Washington, the employee will pay to such disabled employees out of his/her accumulated sick leave, an allowance equal to the difference between the State Workmen's Compensation benefits and the employer's regular gross pay, less statutory deductions. Beginning at the time the employee is certified as disabled by a physician, the leave entitlement is completely exhausted. If the employee is still disabled after his/her earned sick leave allowance is exhausted, the employee will revert to only the pay coverage afforded by State Workmen's Compensation Insurance.

iii In order to receive benefits under this Article, employees may be required at the discretion of the employer to submit evidence, in writing, from a duly licensed medical examiner that, in the opinion of the examiner, the employee was physically unable to return to work on the day for which benefits are claimed.

Emergency procedures 11.26 F i Each site staff, under the leadership of the principal, shall establish emergency procedures in which staff are able to communicate with the principal/supervisor about a situation that is potentially volatile. These emergency procedures will also include methods for providing rapid assistance in emergency situations where a potential for physical harm to an employee is evident. These provisions shall be communicated to all staff members and published in a staff handbook or similar document by the opening day of school.

Assault upon employee ii Any case of assault upon an employee by a student, parent, or guardian shall promptly be reported to the employee's supervisor or designee. The employee's supervisor shall immediately report the situation to the administrator of Human Resources. The District will counsel with the employee on those legal rights and alternative courses of action available to the employee. If there appears to be a conflict of interest, the conflict will be identified, the District will advise the employee, and the employee has the option to seek legal counsel elsewhere.

iii The principal/designee shall inform "on a need-to-know basis" any staff member who may have constant contact with a student if that student in the principal's judgment poses a threat to the staff member.
