General provisions

16.4 A The Board of Directors will continue to hold the right and responsibility to exercise full control over the formulation of basic policy decisions that pertain to the study, maintenance, and instruction in all curriculum and instructional matters, including the plan for staff in-service development goals and programs of the District. The District and its Association also recognize that changes in student enrollment patterns and the community's expectations for alterations in the kind and quality of the educational programs will require the acquisition of new knowledge and skills by the teaching staff and by their certificated support staff.

  i. Individuals must pay for their participation and be reimbursed after completion.
  ii. Verification of participation must be submitted and maintained.
  iii. Individuals may only utilize funds in such a way as to receive direct benefit.
  iv. Funds cannot be donated to another individual, for participation.

16.4 C The District will make every reasonable effort to identify in official publications the areas of the District's curriculum and instructional program that will receive new knowledge and skills, and positions where personnel shortages are contemplated. This information will assist an individual in formulating his/her individual professional development proposal for presentation to his/her evaluator and the Superintendent/designee.
