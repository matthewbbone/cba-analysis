CHAPTER 12. TRI ACTIVITIES & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

Article 12.1
Concept
The TRI program of the Vancouver School District has as its primary objective the enhancement of basic education programs for students.

Article 12.2
The primary intent of TRI is to improve the quality of educational services available for students through the performance of compensated additional responsibilities provided by certificated staff. These TRI responsibilities will go beyond those levels possible within the basic education programs as funded by the state legislature. The legislature's enactment of RCW 28A.400.200 authorizes the District to participate in supplemental contract payments of salaries and benefits its employees who meet certain specific provisions.

12.2 A
The payment is not for services included in the mandatory daily average hours of instruction offered students within the one hundred eighty (180) day school year as is required and funded by the Basic Education Act (RCW 28A.150.229), or within any state funded in-service days.

12.2 B
The supplemental contracts will normally be for one year and not subject to the continuing contract provisions (RCW 28A.405.340).

12.2 C
The funding of the TRI responsibilities is subject to funds available from local sources and other funds allocated outside of the IDEA program.

12.2 D
The nature of the supplemental services and level of compensation is negotiable with the Vancouver Education Association.

Three major elements
12.2 E
TRI, other than for in-service training, is payable in three (3) increments in accordance with Appendix E and provides full compensation for the responsibilities listed in Article 12.5.

12.2 F
The Association and the District recognize that the responsibilities listed in Article 12.5 may involve, due to circumstances, excessive amounts of time. In this regard, the District will exercise reasonable discretion in its expectations of employees and the Association has the right to meet with the principals and/or central office administrators to resolve unreasonable situations, special events, etc.

12.2 G
Building administrators and program managers shall meet with staff to jointly prepare a plan for service that will identify mandatory and flexible responsibilities that will guide the staff in the performance of TRI responsibilities. To the extent possible, the plan will provide a schedule of mandatory meetings/events that is balanced relative to individual, flexible responsibilities and responsibilities that cannot be scheduled. Copies of the plan will be provided to the VEA building representative and the Human Resources Office.

12.2 H
When an employee is in an unavoidable overload situation, the building administrator will minimize demands on the employee's time for TRI responsibilities.
