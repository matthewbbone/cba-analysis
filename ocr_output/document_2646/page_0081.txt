These services will be documented without the need of an individual to maintain a written record to document eight (8) hours of service.

Wednesday for required meetings

Meetings will be based on agenda as agreed for the time allowed. Meetings will not routinely continue beyond the full workday, other than to bring orderly conclusion to a discussion item or to conclude discussion on a critical item that cannot be deferred to the next meeting.
