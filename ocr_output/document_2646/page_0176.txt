Outcome Prediction: If agreement cannot be reached using assisted negotiation, the next best step may be some form of outcome prediction. These processes are attempts to show the parties what might happen if negotiations fail and the parties proceed to litigation. They are generally used to encourage the parties to continue attempting to reach a negotiated settlement and avoid litigation.

Neutral Evaluation:
Neutral third party, who is knowledgeable in the substantive area of the dispute, listens to the facts and legal arguments and attempts to predict the probable range of outcomes before the parties go to more formal proceedings.

Fact Findings:
Neutral third party gives the disputants or the decision-maker findings of fact, possibly with a recommended solution.
Similar to non-binding arbitration.

Ombuds and Complaint Programs:
Supposedly independent person who investigates problems and complaints and attempts to resolve them through mediation or recommended solutions.
Generally seen in government and corporate organizations.

Mini-trial:
Meetings chaired by neutral advisor.
Lawyers present summaries of their cases to chief executives or decision makers representing both sides.
Chief executives or decision makers attempt to settle the case.
If they are unable to reach agreement, the neutral advisor may mediate or recommend a settlement.

Summary Jury Trials
Involves a judge and summary jury participating in an abbreviated hearing and rendering a non-binding verdict, explaining it to participants and answering questions.
Attempts to predict the outcome of a full trial.

Non-binding Arbitration:
Generally part of the litigation process, just before going to trial.
Attempts to settle smaller civil litigation cases.
Arbitrator's decision is non-binding and case can proceed to court if not settled by the parties.

Mediation/Arbitration:
Neutral third party mediates, but if the parties are unable to reach a settlement, will act as arbitrator and impose a decision.
Mediator is not supposed to use any confidential information obtained during mediation in deciding the arbitration.
