CHAPTER 7. PROFESSIONAL PLACEMENT

Article 7.1
Fundamental concepts of placement
The District and the Association acknowledge that the single most critical factor determining the quality of instruction in a school district is its professional staff, as that quality derives from effective procedures of recruitment, selection, and assignment to adjusting to the constantly changing curriculum patterns, new educational techniques, and personnel needs emerging from the needs of students and community. It shall be the policy of the District to recruit, hire, and promote qualified persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, marital status, or because of a handicap, as will best meet the requirements of a specific position opening in a District program.

Article 7.2
Basic placement decisions consideration
7.2 A Educators will normally be assigned, reassigned, or transferred with due recognition to professional qualifications, experience, personal interest, and within the scope of their teaching certificate, as well as their major and minor fields of study, as these factors relate to the identified duties and responsibilities for a specific position opening. All assignment and placement decisions shall be reached on a rational basis of fact, and in a thoughtful and judicious manner. Assignments outside the scope of certification, experience, or of major or minor fields of study, shall be temporary and for emergency reasons only.

Personal preference considerations an objective not a mandate
7.2 B It is an objective of the District to try to place each certified staff member into an assignment of his/her preference whenever this can be done consistent with providing a high quality instructional program for the students of the community. However, the District is not required and will not reassign an individual to an open position of preference for which he/she may qualify by preparation and interest when it cannot reasonably become filling a qualified candidate from within the District or from another financially feasible from outside the District, to fill the position he/she would leave.

Article 7.3
