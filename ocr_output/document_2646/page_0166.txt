SUMMARY STATEMENT OF GROUP INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS 2003-04

Pursuant to Article 11.31 and Article 11.32/11.33, the programs and benefits determined by the District and the Association, effective October 1, 2003 for all members of the bargaining unit are deemed to be the following for full-time employees and proportionally prorated for part-time employees (details of each program's benefits are outlined in the policy statements on file in the District office of fiscal services and the information booklets issued to each employee).

The District will contribute a maximum of $493.31 for the months of September 2003 through August 2004, per FTE towards the mandatory and voluntary insurance programs. The cost of the mandatory "John Hancock/UniCare" insurance programs is the first deduction from the District contribution.

Mandatory Insurance Programs

The John Hancock/UniCare insurance programs are self-insured. The Vancouver School District administers this program with all employee group representatives serving as an advisory committee. This committee, the Insurance Oversight Committee, monitors the assets and liabilities on a monthly basis and recommends any necessary changes in premiums or benefits to maintain the solvency of the program. The deductions for the monthly premium paid by the individual employee are subject to adjustment during the contract year. Beginning in September of 2003, the mandatory rates are as follows:

Blue Cross participants: $151.04
Kaiser participants: $153.42
Participants not enrolled in a medical plan: $153.42

Less than full-time employees may exempt themselves from the mandatory package if the employer contribution is not sufficient to cover cost of benefits.
