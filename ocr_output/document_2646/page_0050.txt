7.3 B v.b. The assignment will terminate upon the return of the standard assignment teacher, a drop in student enrollment, or at the end of the school year, whichever comes first. However, if the individual is not replacing a teacher on indeterminate sick or other similar leave, he/she should be offered a contract for the remainder of the year or a provisional contract if he/she has served ninety (90) days or more, been evaluated as performing satisfactory service and is likely to continue the student attendance rate in the assigned position. A term substitute replacement is treated like any other teacher and the position will be subject to PTR placement for the ensuing school year. If qualified and registered PTR candidates are not available, the District may permanently assign the position to the former term substitute or another candidate.

v.c. The first twenty (20) days of service will normally be paid at the minimum daily rate of the first step of the salary schedule. Exceptions to place the employee at the scheduled rate may be made by the Administrator of Human Resources when necessary to meet the needs of the District. On the twenty-first (21) day of service the teacher will be placed on the salary schedule according to higher qualifications and below the highest rated teacher in the same assignment subject, with representation fees, and eligible for membership in the Association. Similarly, an employee initially placed at the Board approved daily substitute rate for a period of time expected to be not more than twenty (20) days whose placement subsequently exceeds twenty (20) days will be placed on the scheduled rate and become a member of the teachers' bargaining unit, subject to all other terms and conditions eligible for membership in the Association on the twenty-first (21) day. The placement on payroll in each case will become effective at the next cut-off date following the twenty-first (21) day. A term substitute will be eligible for enrollment in the group insurance plans of the District following a thirty-one (31) working day period of employment in the same assignment. An employee who:

1. is assigned to a term substitute appointment that meets the requirements of Article 7.3, and
2. who completes the 21st working day qualifying period, and
3. whose term sub appointment subsequently terminates; and
4. who again assigned as a term sub under Article 7.3 in the same school year;
5. will not be required to complete a second qualifying period, and
6. will be eligible to subscribe to health benefits on the first day of the month following the first month in which they work a majority of the working days.

v.d. Re-employed Annuitants: When a retired employee is placed on a one-year contract or as a term substitute, the employee will be entitled to the following compensation and benefits:
1. Payment from the first day of the term substitute or one year assignment at the appropriate per diem rate based on education and years of experience.
2. Coverage under the dental, vision, and prescription insurance program if employed as .38 or greater FTE.
3. Entitlement to TRJ on the same basis as all other employees if employed for 5 or greater FTE.
