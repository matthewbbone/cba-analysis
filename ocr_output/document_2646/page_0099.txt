One (1) or more of the following actions will be utilized as is mutually determined through the consultation of the principal, site administrator, and the District administration and appropriate building multidisciplinary team.

10.24 J Support Services Staff. Due to the widely varying range of rules and responsibilities of support services staff (psychologists, nurses, SLP, motor team, and counselors), it is difficult to establish average or typical workloads and conditions. Therefore, it is agreed that the review process to resolve concerns in a timely manner is as follows:

i The district administrator for special services will have the primary responsibility for each special services certified category conduct an analysis of each employee's workload by October 1 of each school year and again by February 1 of each school year. The review will take its ing part into account the following areas of candidate assignment with consideration to such things as students assigned, severity of cases, geographic dispersion, number of buildings assigned, etc. The results of the analysis and assigned changes will be shared with all employees of the respective group.

ii At any time during the year that an employee believes his/her caseload is disproportionate to other employees, the employee may initiate a discussion with his/her supervisor and appropriate building administrator(s) to problem solve the concern. The employee has the option of VEA representation during this discussion.
