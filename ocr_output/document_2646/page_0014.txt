Building access

3.2 L One (1) named Association officer, the employed executive director and the administrative assistant to the executive director of the Association shall have access to all District buildings and to certified employees at such times as will not interfere with the instructional responsibilities of the staff to carry out their assigned responsibilities in the development and administration of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement and staff grievance procedures. The officer(s) may make routine communications and relationships for school district operation. Members of the Association's executive board shall have reasonable right of entry/exit among the buildings of the District to carry out the responsibilities of their offices, outside of the regular student attendance hours, with faculty representatives and Professional Rights and Responsibilities Committee representatives (Article 5.12).

Visiting state and national affiliate officers and staff and local association members without the assigned responsibility of development and administration of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement (see Article 3.2 B and 5.12 for authorized local extensibility permits in each building) do not have access to employees in the bargaining unit on school district premises during the regular student instructional time, except as provided by law or if one-half (1/2) hour before and one-half (1/2) hour after the student instructional day, except as may be allowed by specific written permission of the Superintendent/designee.

Upon entering a school facility, an authorized Association representative shall inform the principal or principal's designee (in their absence the building secretary) of such presence in the building. Such visitation shall not interfere with any employee's assigned duties and responsibilities.
