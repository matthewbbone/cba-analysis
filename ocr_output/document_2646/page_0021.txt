Article 5.6

Level III Step 3

Arbitration
5.6 A If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level II because it has determined that the grievance involves the interpretation, meaning, or application of any of the provisions of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement, it may, by written notice to the office of the Superintendent within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the decision, submit the grievance to arbitration.

Procedures for selection of an arbitrator
5.6 B Within ten (10) days after written notice of submission to arbitration, the office of the Superintendent/designee and the Association will attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator or obtain consent from the American Arbitration Association. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator or to obtain such a commitment within the ten (10) day period, a request for a list of arbitrators may be made to the American Arbitration Association by either party. The parties will be bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.

Powers & authority of arbitrator
5.6 C The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which violates, alters, adds to, or subtracts from the terms of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no power to substitute higher discretion for that of the Board in any manner not specifically contained within the Board's "List of Discretionary Authority." If such question will be ruled on first by the arbitrator selected to hear the dispute. The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth further findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Board and the Association and will be binding on the District, the Association, and/or the aggrieved employee.

Limits on evidence on Level III hearings
5.6 D Neither party shall be permitted to assert in the arbitration proceedings any evidence which was not submitted to the other party before the completion of Level II meetings.

Arbitrator's hearings & time limits
5.6 E The arbitrator selected will confer with the representatives of the Office of the Superintendent and the Association, will hold hearings promptly, and will issue his/her decision not later than twenty (20) days from the date of the close of the hearings, or if oral hearings have been waived, from the date the final statements and proofs are submitted to him/her.

Arbitration costs
5.6 F The costs of the services of the arbitrator including per diem expenses, if any, and his/her travel, subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing room, will be borne equally by the Board and the Association. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them.
