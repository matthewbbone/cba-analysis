Vacancy 7.3 F Vacancy: A vacancy refers to an opening in an existing or newly-created position in which no currently employed qualified member of the bargaining unit has expressed an interest through the Position Interest Register, or no currently interested employee possesses the qualifications and is selected to fill the position (Article 7.7). A vacancy may be filled by employment of an individual from outside the District. An opening in existence or occurring between July 15 and October 15 may be considered a vacancy subject to the PER provisions of this chapter.

Position Interest Register declared & described 7.3 G
A Position Interest Register procedure will be maintained by the Human Resources Office to provide an employee the opportunity to officially register his/her interest and willingness to be considered and assigned to a position opening(s) when it appears.

Specific position(s) interest
i. An employee may file for a specific position opening(s). A request for assignment to a specific position will constitute an employee's authorization for him/her to be placed in the position at any time it becomes available without the necessity of additional consultation with the Human Resources Office.
ii. An employee may file a general transfer and/or reassignment interest request indicating that he/she is interested and will accept any open position for which notice may be qualified by certification or the eligible preparation, i.e., name and number only once assigned to the same contract area as listed in the Human Resources Office. Employees will be restricted in their selection of sites for which they wish to be considered to three (3) sites for secondary employees and four (4) sites for elementary employees.
iii. The Human Resources Office will maintain, in conjunction with the regular Position Interest Register, an opportunity for employees to provide specific and accurate information of addresses and phone numbers where they may be contacted during the summer, to be notified when there is an opening in a position of interest to them. Unless the employee files a summer service request, the Human Resources Office will not notify an employee by telephone or reassignment notice to notify the employee of openings of interest to him/her as listed in the regular Position Interest Register between the last duty day of one (1) school year and August 15.

Duration of interest listings
iv.a. An employee's position interest(s) in the Position Interest Register will expire automatically August 15 of each year. Employees may register between January 1 and March 14 for the ensuing year.
iv.b. A position interest request for a position may be withdrawn by the employee at any time prior to the time a reassignment has actually been made.
iv.c. Employees are responsible for investigating the sites for which they register and will be deleted from the register if they receive and decline a compatible position offer. An employee may subsequently decline a previously accepted assignment if significant circumstances warrant and conditions permit.
