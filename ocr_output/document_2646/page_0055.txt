7.7 B iv District employees, other than special services who are on 1.0 FTE assignments that are split between buildings and who have made themselves available for placement on the current PIR, will be afforded the opportunity to respond in a single location (in writing) prior to placing a non-district employee in the position.

Bulletin procedures, posted positions

7.7 C i All position openings will be posted on the VSD's web site. Immediately after the position is posted, all certified employees will be notified through the District's email that a position has been posted to the web inviting them to view the posting if interested.

Schools without technology
ii For schools that are not current with technology, the posting(s) will be faxed to the secretary for posting in the building in a location where all employees will have the opportunity to view all posted positions.

iii The Association acknowledges that when there is an expending student enrollment and a decline in the number of high quality candidates in short supply for certain kinds of positions, the District may have a need to offer "letters of intent" to applicants as early as a year in advance to persons from outside the District. This suggestion is intended to assure that well-qualified personnel are obtained for the ensuing school year. However, the Human Resources Office will make the specific placement of the new employee consistent with PIR requirements. In especially difficult recruiting situations, and with the Association's consent, the district may commit to and specify the placement in the letter of intent and not subject it to the PIR process.

It is further acknowledged that when a building (administrative unit) staff has participated in the extensive planning and organizing of a program employees may be retained in the positions for the ensuing school year.

7.7 D The outgoing Association president will have first seniority in PIR placement.
