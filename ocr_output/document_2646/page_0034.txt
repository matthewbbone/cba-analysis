Article 6.2

Employee Illness, Injury, and Emergency Leave

Basic formula full & part-time
6.2 A
Illness, injury, and emergency leave will be earned by each employee at the rate of eight (8) hours for each calendar month of contracted employment, September through August (twelve [12] days per year for a full contract). Part-time contracted employees will accrue leave days proportionate to the time they work each day.

6.2 B
Illness, injury, and emergency leave will accrue through the employee's contracted work year. Illness, injury, and emergency leave will accrue from year to year with a maximum accumulation of one hundred eighty (180) days.

Former employees
6.2 C
An employee returning to employment in the District will be entitled to retaining all illness, injury, and emergency leave benefits recorded to his/her credit at the time of his/her earlier termination.

Transfer of benefits
6.2 D
Employees entering the employment of this school district who have a sick leave balance from another Washington school district or public school jurisdiction are entitled to transfer to this school district such sick leave balance that the employee may have accumulated in that former employment. The employee is responsible for notifying this District of such entitlement within thirty (30) days of initial employment and providing proof of such balance within ninety (90) days of initial employment. Failure to meet these requirements will result in the employee's forfeiture of such transfer. These notification periods may be extended by the administrator responsible for human resources if this District fails to notify the employee of their entitlement at the time of hire or if the former District requires additional time to provide the necessary verification.

Extensions of benefits
6.2 E
An employee suffering extended illness or physical incapacity compelling continuous absence beyond the term of the individual's accumulated illness, injury, and emergency leave benefits may apply for a limited extension of benefits not yet earned. Upon recommendation of the Superintendent and upon approval of the Board of Directors, such extended illness, injury, and emergency leave will be granted in increments of forty (40) hours during each prior contracted year of service to the District, not to exceed two hundred (200) hours. Extended leave, when combined with accumulated earned leave, may not exceed a total of one hundred eighty (180) days of total accumulated/extended leave. These days are to be charged against future illness, injury, and emergency leave entitlements. The employee will return to the District if future employment does not provide illness, injury, and emergency leave entitlement. Extension of this leave is at the discretion of the District and is based on a reasonable expectation that the employee will return to work for a sufficient period to liquidate the extended leave through normal leave accrual.
