3.2 C It is understood that Association leaders will not release a District staff directory or set of mailing labels to any political party, an individual candidate for political office, an individual business to permit them making direct contact with employees, or provide access in an individual capacity. The mailing label(s) may be utilized for the purpose of an Association membership in conducting official Association business, generally in the summer. The distribution of a newsletter announcing a collective bargaining settlement under meeting, or information about Association sponsored and endorsed products or services, or the voting record tabulations and similar information about the performance of District staff officers (during the qualification of a candidate) for purposes involving the merits of specific candidates may pertain to teacher welfare are all topics amenable for publicity in such a capacity.

v Any concern regarding the Association's use of the District's communication services and bulletin boards shall be a matter for early discussion between the Association president or representative(s) and the Superintendent/director. A resolution of this Article may result in the suspension of the Association's use of the District's mail or e-mail services for an appropriate period of time following such an Administration-Association conference.

District information availability 3.2 D The Association shall be furnished monthly and annual financial statements and the preliminary and adopted budgets and financial reports, Board agendas and supporting materials if a timely manner. Nothing herein is intended to compel any communication with staff to research or assemble information that has not been routinely prepared in the normal operation of the District.

The Association will furnish copies of information pertinent to employee-employee relations topics as reasonably requested by the Superintendent or the Board.

Scheduling meetings 3.2 E It is mutually understood that effective communication among all parties to the Agreement provides for a more effective labor relations environment.

When the day is scheduled in advance to accommodate both the Association and the faculty begins within the on-site day. Administrators and building representatives will assure that Association and faculty meetings begin and/or end on schedule so as not to interfere with one another. The faculty representative shall privately inform the supervisor(s) prior to the night meeting if the supervisor(s) are invited to remain in the meeting for the Association portion of the meeting. If (supervisor(s)) are not invited to stay, they should leave the staff meeting and go to the association portion of the meeting. The faculty representative may schedule additional Association meetings before and after the students attendance day.
