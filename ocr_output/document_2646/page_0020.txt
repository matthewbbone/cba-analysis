Article 5.4

Appropriate informal efforts to resolve complaints

Within a reasonable period of time, and not more than twenty (20) days, after a grievant knows or should have known about the action, lack of action, or other matter that gives rise to filing a grievance, the educator either personally or accompanied by his/her Association representative shall meet and discuss the complaint with his/her building principal or other "appropriate supervisor." The initial twenty (20) day period is intended to allow time for informal efforts toward the resolution of a complaint prior to the filing of a written grievance. If reasonable efforts for resolution of a complaint have been made, the exhaustion of the full twenty (20) day time period is not necessary for invoking the formal grievance procedure.

Level I Step 1

Written referral to appropriate supervisor

If a certified employee has not been able to resolve his/her complaint to his/her satisfaction with his/her appropriate supervisor by informal means, he/she may submit his/her complaint in writing on forms provided to be processed through the established grievance procedures. The appropriate supervisor shall, within five (5) days of the day the grievance was delivered to him/her, render a written decision in the matter with a brief rationale for such decision based on the record of further findings at the investigation of the complaint.

Level I Complaint Settlement

A settlement reached at a complaint at Level I by an individual teacher and administrator without the formal involvement of the Association and the District will not constitute precedent that the Association or the District believe that the settlement decisions are the proper interpretation of the language of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement.

Article 5.5

Level II Step 2

Written referral to office of the Superintendent

If the action taken at Step I is not satisfactory to the Association, or as written decision has been rendered, the Association may, within ten (10) days after the decision or the date the decision should have been rendered, refer the grievance to the Superintendent/Adviser at Level II. The written notice shall include a statement as to why the decision, if any, was not satisfactory.

Obligations of conference

Within ten (10) days of the date the grievance was appointed, the Superintendent/Adviser shall arrange for a grievance adjustment conference with the Association. The District and the Association have the right to include in the representation at the conference such individuals and consultants as they deem necessary to develop the facts and information pertinent to the grievance.

Time period for decision

Upon the conclusion of the conference, the office of the Superintendent/Adviser shall have five (5) days to provide a written decision, together with the reasons for the decision, to the Association.
