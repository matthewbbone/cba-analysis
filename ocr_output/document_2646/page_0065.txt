If the Superintendent concurs with the supervisor's judgment that the performance of the employee is unsatisfactory, the Superintendent shall place the employee in a probationary status at any time after October 15 and ending after sixty (60) school days. Prior to the Superintendent's decision to invoke probationary status, the employee may request a review of his/her performance by the principal or supervisor and the principal or supervisor will invite Superintendent/designee for the District. The employee may, at his/her option, have a representative from the Association accompany him/her to the review conference meeting. On or before the beginning of the probation period, the employee shall be given written notice of the action of the Superintendent, which notice shall contain the following information:

8.10 A i. Specific areas of performance deficiencies.

8.10 B i. Suggested specific and reasonable program for improvement.

8.10 C i. A statement indicating the duration of the probationary period and that the purpose of the probationary period is to give the employee the opportunity to demonstrate improvement in his/her area(s) of deficiency.

Provided an employee shall be afforded procedures and safeguards similar to the above except that the requirement for a probable cause determination by the Superintendent and a sixty (60) school-day probation period does not apply. Such employees will be:

8.10 A ii. Provided with written notice of their deficiencies by the Superintendent/designee at any time that performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory.

8.10 B ii. Provided with a suggested specific and reasonable plan for improvement.

8.10 C ii. Provided an opportunity to meet with the Superintendent/designee and with an Association representative, at their option, to review the principal's report and the proposed improvement plan, and to provide input to the plan of improvement.
