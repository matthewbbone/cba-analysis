9.4 B Outside speakers on controversial topics may be used when available instructional materials or media resources are inadequate. Administrative approval must be obtained prior to scheduling any guest speaker. Such approval will be exercised in a manner consistent with the principles of free inquiry and expression. If, in the opinion of the administrator, the presence or rhetoric of the speaker will result in unwarranted persuasion to non-consensual students, then another person of similar viewpoints have a similar opportunity to be heard. The administrator may withhold approval when he/she has reason to believe that a speaker or his/her message would hinder or disrupt the orderly functioning of the school.

The teacher may request a written statement from the administrator specifying the reasons for withholding approval. It is recognized that the decision not to use such speakers is a matter within the discretion of the Superintendent/Designer and appeals from this decision are limited to step 2 of the grievance procedure, i.e., not subject to the arbitration procedure.

Article 9.5
"Hidden bugs" prohibited
No mechanical or electronic device shall be installed in any classroom or brought in on a temporary basis by which records are made of the procedures, activities, conversations, and events in any class without the full knowledge of its presence and specific intended purpose of the record and the written consent by the educator responsible for conducting the class.

Article 9.6
Public Expression

The District and the Association recognize that educators are usually well-informed regarding the curriculum, the general operation of the schools, and the way the funds available in the District are being spent. Citizens in the educator group should feel free to speak out on such matters to their fellow citizens without fear of District censorship or discipline. However, an educator should take into account both the content and the method of presentation of any public criticisms as to their potential for improving the educational system and the long-range benefits they may have for students. An educator should not knowingly disclose confidential information about personal matters directly or indirectly, or use personal invective in his/her public expressions of opinion. Each educator should clearly distinguish in his/her public statements between personal opinions and when he/she may be serving as a spokesperson for the District or the Association.

Public expression as defined by U.S. Supreme Court decisions provide the following guidelines:

9.6 A While public employees have the right to self-expression on matters of public concern, their speech may not be disruptive to the workplace.

9.6 B The employee's interest in public expression on an issue of public concern must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause to the interest of the District, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.

9.6 C An employee has the right to criticize policies or practices in his/her school system in remarks communicated privately to his/her supervisor without fear of being disciplined for that.
