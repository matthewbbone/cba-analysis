14.14.8 If the layoff and recall under the normal procedures would result in causing or aggravating an imbalance in the certificated staff's ethnic and/or male/female representation within a given employment area, then such layoff and recall shall be accomplished by applying to each group represented by numbers that are less than those represented by the group(s) represented by numbers that are greater. If the number of persons within the underrepresented group is reduced by more than 10% (as closely as may be practicable), the number of persons within the area as a whole is reduced. The layoff and recall within each underrepresented group shall be accomplished by applying to the members of the underrepresented group based on normal selection rules set forth above.
