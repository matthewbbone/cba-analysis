Article 10-8

Responsibilities of All Classroom Teachers During & After School

Job description review

10.8 A Each year employees in the bargaining unit will be given the opportunity to meet with their immediate supervisor to review the responsibilities and duties of his/her job description. They will discuss the degree of accuracy the written job description has with the actual activities as required by the supervisor and carried out by the individual during the prior work year. Any significant differences in the written action build your duties will be identified and noted, and brought to the attention of the Personnel Resources Office for review and possible revision. The responsibilities and duties necessary beyond the one hundred eighty (180) day basic teacher year should also be reviewed. The review should determine how many of the extended year duties meet, how much should, and how many could be done (funding available). The review will identify the varying levels of quality of service possible in accordance with extra days available to do the work.

Major responsibility instruction

The major responsibility of the teaching staff is in the area of classroom instruction. However, to assure the success of the total school program, other related responsibilities dealing with scheduleable supervision and control are, of necessity, a part of the teacher's position.

Staff assistant assistance

Where deemed feasible by the administration and the staff and within the budget limitations, staff assistants will be provided to assist in the performance of non-instructional duties.

Equal sharing of extra duties

The remaining non-instructional responsibilities which are normal to the day-to-day operation of the school day program shall be assigned equitably among the certificated staff.

Student body activities/volunteerism

10.8 B The Board and the Association agree that the certificated staff should share the responsibilities involved in student body activities. It is recognized that certified employee participation in student body activities will be voluntary.

Hours of student body service

Early in each year a building administrator will identify for the building faculty assembled the student activities planned for the ensuing year and the number of adults that will be required to be in attendance to assure adequate supervision.

Adults from the community should be recruited by the building administration by all reasonable methods to fill as many assignments as are prudent from that source. The preferences of teachers must be considered in making duty assignments. Individuals may volunteer for as many hours of student body service as they choose.

Parental rights

10.8 C A teacher may be required to meet with parents at one (1) evening meeting each year to explain the curriculum program and/or the instructional procedures to be followed in class. (Note: The date of such meeting will be communicated to teachers not later than the first week of school.)
