ii The District agrees to provide kindergarten teachers with a total of two hundred and ten (210) minutes of planning time per week composed of thirty (30) minutes per day of planning time to adjourn the lunch period, and two, thirty (30) minute media release periods per week to adjourn where possible, a recess period.

iii Normal circumstances are deemed to be days when specialist teachers are not absent from duty. The District will make every reasonable effort to provide substitute teachers for absent specialist teachers.

iv Specialist educators shall have an equivalent total amount of planning time as the rest of the teaching staff in that building. Scheduling permitting, planning time for specialist teachers will include four, thirty (30) minute blocks. A specialist teacher who does not receive the four, thirty minute blocks in one year will be afforded the opportunity for a schedule change for the subsequent year either within or outside of the building.

v When substitute teachers are unavailable the provisions in Article 10.7 B apply.

School day student supervision to be minimal
10.6 D Every reasonable effort will be made to not require an elementary teacher to be responsible for the traffic safety patrol or the supervision of cafeteria and playground. The District will attempt to relieve or severely limit the elementary teacher's responsibility for supervising children whenever such responsibilities can, within funding limitations, legally be assigned to non-certificated persons, aides or volunteers.

Elementary parent conferencing, shortened days
10.6 E If TRT resources are not available as specified in Chapter 12, no less than 780 minutes per year of release time for elementary teacher-parent conferences shall be scheduled by the principal and teacher staff. This minimum will be proportionately adjusted for any reduction in TRT resources due to funding limitations.

A teacher shall not be required to have a face-to-face conference with parent(s) of each child enrolled in a class during the first scheduled parent-teacher conference period. The teacher may, however, be required to document efforts to communicate with parents by phone log or letter not to exceed once per year. All teachers of kindergarten students will have face conference once a year. The District will make every reasonable effort to provide telephone lines and instruments available at times and places to facilitate convenient and private communications with parents.

Kindergarten conferencing
10.6 F Each kindergarten teacher will be allowed four and one-half (4 1/2) days of substitute teacher service for parent conferencing. Half-time (1/3) kindergarten teachers will be allowed five (5), half-days of substitute service.
