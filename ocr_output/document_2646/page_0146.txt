ii. Updating teachers to provide effective service to students in the present or in a revised curriculum program as may be adopted by the District.

iii. Maintaining certification.

Teacher assistance

16.5 B An individual may be required to participate in a particular professional development opportunity if there is abundant evidence that such involvement is critical to improvement of the professional performance of his/her current assignment and/or s/he is placed on formal probation or at "high risk" for probation. These costs may be charged to the individual professional development funds.

Mandatory Training

16.5 C The District may direct up to sixteen (16) hours per year of professional development training for which the employee will be reimbursed at the approved hourly rate from the $725 annual fund. Such mandatory training will be communicated not later than the close of the previous school year by the appropriate official and must fix their remaining expenses. Any additional mandatory training will be subject to approval of other officials and would be scheduled in consultation with the Association and with alternative provisions to accommodate employees who cannot attend at the scheduled time.

Article 16.6

Individual professional development funds

The District will allocate individual professional development funds in the described amounts. Certified employees may participate on a voluntary basis, and may access these funds in accordance with the provisions in this chapter.

16.6 A Reimbursement levels:

i. Each full-time teacher on provisional or continuing contract may receive up to $725 of professional development funds per school year. These teachers are also eligible to be reimbursed for expenses beyond $725, but not to exceed $1,000 from any residual funds, on an application after the last day of June. Such residual funds will be distributed proportionately after the initial claims and payment process with no teacher over the base of $725 restricted to district-approved college and university programs and coursework. An exception to the use of residual funds for reimbursement of workshops and conferences may be made for education staff associates who require such professional development (i.e., out of state travel) for required re-certification, which cannot be obtained through any other means. The District will pay a percentage based on total residual funds relative to total approved expenses beyond $725. The District will have the discretion to make payouts beyond the $1,000 limit when residual funds are available.

ii. Part-time teachers, and full-time teachers who have not worked the full year, may receive an amount equal to their FTE percentage (e.g., a half-time teacher, or a full-time teacher hired at midyear, may receive $362.50 of the basic amount and 50 percent of any authorized residual amount.)

iii. Teachers on one-year appointments may receive up to $725 for activities taken and completed by the last student day of the school year.

iv. Teachers employed less than 0.4 FTE, and teachers on terminable substitute appointments, do not receive professional development funds.

16.6 B Expenses which qualify for reimbursement include:

i. Registration fees, credit fees, textbooks, and materials for approved courses, workshops, conferences, and seminars.
