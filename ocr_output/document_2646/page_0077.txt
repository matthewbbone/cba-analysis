Article 9.18

Mutual Respect & Courtesy Conferences of Employees, Especially Privacy & Dignity Concerns

Private conference sessions
9.18 A The parties agree that when employees have strong differences of opinion between and among themselves it is expected that such differences should be approached through rational discussions held among and limited to only the "parties of interest" held in a private place. All employees are expected to refrain from use of critical and invasive expression of each other in the presence of the public (students, other employees, and citizens) in semi-public places such as faculty lounges, hallways, etc.

Administrators critical of employees
9.18 B Administrators will discuss problems of the employee's performance and verbally admonish or reprimand employees in private with only those Association representatives and other witnesses as requested or necessary to the process to be in attendance. A hearing is contemplated, however, when a formal representative memorandum of a teacher's performance is not to be made available to a parent or other general citizen except as may be required by the law of the state of Washington or by procedures of a formal hearing conducted by the District or by a court order. Whenever a building administrator requests a conference with a member of the Association, he/she will notify the employee's immediate supervisor that the Association. If additional administrators are included, the subordinates will be granted enough time to obtain a representative of his/her choosing, if so desired, to be included in the conference.

Employees critical of administrators
9.18 C A teacher with a personal complaint or grievance(s) with an individual administrator's decisions or action will apply this provision in the forum, the private grievance procedure conference situation, which has been established for dealing with that kind of problem with only a faculty and/or Professional Rights and Responsibilities representative and other persons in attendance that may have information of importance necessary to the resolution of the problem.

Employees critical of employees
9.18 D A teacher with a complaint about another employee(s) (teacher, supervisor, aide, etc.) should first try to resolve the differences between and among themselves in a private conversation. If this does not resolve the problem an employee may request an appropriate building administrator to conduct it personally or in conjunction with all parties of concern to facilitate a solution. The administrator takes all necessary administrative summary action to finally resolve the dispute to assure the orderly operation of the school.

Concern for dignity of others
9.18 E Any employee may be subject to an appropriate disciplinary action for failing to exercise reasonable, good judgement in handling interpersonal disputes and is expected to exercise respect, courtesy, and concern for the dignity of other employees.

9.18 F The District agrees not to have press releases regarding the disciplinary action of a member of the Association's bargaining unit.
