evaluation of the progress, if any, made by the employee. The written evaluation of progress will be provided to the employee at the end of each month. Beginning with the probationary period, an employee may have an Association representative present during the twice-monthly conferences concerning evaluation reports.

8.12 C  The probationary employee may be removed from probation at any time if he/she has demonstrated improvement to the satisfaction of the principal or designated evaluation supervisor in those areas specifically detailed in the improvement program evaluation meetings.

Article 8.13
Recommendation for non-renewal

In cases where recommendations for improvement are not affected and deficiencies are not corrected during the prescribed probationary period, the supervisor will advise the employee of such a conclusion and at the fact that the supervisor must recommend that the employee's service contract not be renewed for the following year.

Article 8.14
Immediate reassignment

Immediately following the completion of a probationary period that does not produce performance changes detailed in the initial notice of deficiencies and improvement program, the employee may be removed from his or her assignment and placed into an alternative assignment for the remainder of the school year. This reassignment may not displace another employee nor may it adversely affect the probationary employee's compensation or benefits for the remainder of the employee's contract year. If such reassignment is not possible, the District may, at its option, place the employee on paid leave for the balance of the contract term.

Article 8.15
Forms required for use in evaluation process

8.15 A  The observation form is designed and intended for use as an instrument of detailed and immediate communication between the employee and the supervisor in their ongoing relationship. It is mandated for use in evaluation conferences and such conferences shall be conducted at least once per year, with more frequent changes at each time that the supervisor or employee deems a performance discussion to be appropriate. Not fewer than two (2) visits, a total of sixty (60) minutes, will be scheduled each year. At the conclusion of each conference where the Classroom/Professional Activities Observation Notes form has been used, both the employee and the evaluator will sign the form, indicating that the form represents a report of the information communicated at the conference. It does not necessarily determine the employee's final performance in the event of a corrective action or improvement plan. The form may be retained by both the employee and the evaluator and will not be placed in the employee's personnel file. Observation notes are intended as working notes of the evaluator and the teacher for their exclusive use and should generally only be provided to the Human Resources Office when that office is providing assistance to the supervisor or the employee in performance improvement or probational development planning.

Employee's signature acknowledges, supervisor's comments

8.15 B  The Summative Evaluation Report is a formal and official summary evaluation based on a series of documented observations, critical incidents, supervisory reports, and consultations, which are out of contracted performance. This report should reflect the previous discussions recorded on the appropriate forms. It is signed by both the employee and the evaluator. A copy will be provided to the employee. The supervisor may not make corrections or changes in the content or assessment of the substance of the final evaluation conference. Each Summative Evaluation Report shall be forwarded to the Human Resources Office for filing in the employee's personnel file. The employee will have the right to append to this form a pertinent rebuttal statement for the record. Such supplementary statements will be submitted to the Human Resources Office within ten (10) days.
