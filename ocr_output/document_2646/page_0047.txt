6.13 F Qualified employees seeking reinstatement shall have preference over current employees in filling of any vacancy in the year(s) of a budget crisis.

6.13 G Eligibility for the reinstatement of an employee on leave during and at the conclusion of the time of a budget crisis year shall be set on the basis of prioritized lists developed by applying the criteria used to determine the position, cause for non-renewal or dismissal in the layoff and recall procedures. Employees determined most eligible for reinstatement will be the first to be reinstated.

6.13 H i All certificated employees who receive notice of probable cause of non-renewal or discharge of their teaching contracts will be placed in a District employment pool, which shall be used to fill vacancies in the District which thereafter occurs. Any vacancy (part-time or full-time) in the District will be filled by an available, qualified individual from the pool, consistent with reduction in force procedures. The term "vacancy" shall be liberally construed and shall include all positions that may become vacant for any reason.

ii Employment of an individual from outside the employment pool will be allowed only if there is no individual voluntarily available in the pool and reasonably qualified for a specific vacancy.

6.13 I Certificated employees will be retained in the District employment pool until reemployed, or resigned, or by allowing their economic leave to lapse by not making a timely annual application for an extension. (See Article 6.13 D) Any individual in the pool will, on request, be placed on the substitute teacher list for the following year.

6.13 J Any individual in the bargaining unit who may not have been named for non-renewal or discharge by operation of the layoff and recall criteria and procedures may, of his/her own volition, without regard for normal application deadlines and prior to the opening of a school year or semester, apply for and receive a budget crisis leave under the provisions of RCW 28A.405.900 to allow an individual from the employment pool to serve in higher regular assignments for a stipulated half or full school year.

6.13 K Any employee on District budget crisis leave will be considered to have continuing employment status with the District for the purposes of the reinstatement of layoff status (reinstatement, salary schedules, etc.) and for group insurance benefits. He/she shall be provided the opportunity to make mutually satisfactory and necessary arrangements to provide direct payment through the District's pay system for the continuation of such insurance programs during the period(s) of his/her leave.
