6.11 G The parties acknowledge that the District's first and foremost responsibility is to provide an effective instructional program for the students. Non-emergency personal business leaves of teaching staff may need to be proportionately curtailed within the number of qualified substitute teachers available at various times during the school year and on certain days of a school week. The District and Association will make every reasonable effort to recruit qualified personnel to expand the substitute list to reduce the number of limitations that will need to be made for people applying for leaves.

Critical periods opening & closing a school year
i It is essential that a school year opens and closes in an effective and businesslike manner, which requires the presence of the regular teacher. Personal business leave will not normally be granted during the first five (5) days and last ten (10) days of a school year; exceptions allowed only for clearly stated and compelling reasons.

ii The parties recognize that the demand for substitutes does vary at different time periods for a variety of reasons: flu epidemics, Fridays and Mondays (first prior to following school day holiday); special events. Attendance messages are considered confidential. The District will give first priority to the assignment of available substitutes to replace a teacher who is ill or injured. The District may limit the number of personal business leaves allowed on any one (1) day to 2% of the total District certificated staff. The District may further restrict the 2% limit in compelling situations where it is reasonable to conclude that substitute teachers are not available for assignment. This limitation is in addition to the specific authority of principals and supervisors to approve or disapprove individual leave requests. Within the District-wide limitation, personal business leaves will normally be approved in the order in which the leave was approved by the supervisor, then submitted to the automated substitute system or as appropriate.

6.11 H Application for personal business leave should be made as far in advance as possible and not less than twenty-four (24) hours to allow the District ample opportunity to determine if a qualified substitute is available and the teacher can be released.

Individual Days 6.11 I An employee will not be required to provide a verbal or written explanation of the reasons for personal business leave, providing the employee is not under a verbal or written caution for excessive or unauthorized absences or tardiness, and providing the absence would not compromise significant pre-scheduled academic or site-based activities as determined by the employee and the immediate supervisor.
