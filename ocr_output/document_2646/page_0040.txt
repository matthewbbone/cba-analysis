A request for such leave shall include a statement describing what holy day is to be observed and attesting as providing documentary evidence that the basic tenets of the educator's religious affiliation unequivocally require observance of the holy days in such a manner that he/she cannot perform the contracted educational responsibility on that day.

An educator taking religious leave may be required to make up missed days prior to opening of school, winter or spring holiday, or after the close of school, as may be mutually determined by the educator and his/her immediate supervisor.
