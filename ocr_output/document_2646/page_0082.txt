Vehicle arrival & departure time

10.5 D The immediate supervisor will, at his/her discretion, assign staff and each individual certificated employee under higher direction as appropriate -- regular daily starting and departure times as well best meet the particular needs, duties, and responsibilities of the particular assignment and within the parameters of Article 10.2 B and WAC 180-44-030.

Provisions governing alterations in duty work schedule

10.5 E Consistent with the requirement of being available for a specific student or parent conference (WAC 180-44-030), an individual educator may, upon specific approval of another principal, or designee, arrive late or leave directly from school to attend a meeting, training session, professional activity, or activity on five valid personal business reasons not possible to complete at a different time that require higher attendance for those voluntary extended day program services he/she has, or will provide, in the student's interest. District which would substantially extend the regular end of the school and one-half (1/2) hour, but otherwise consistent with respect to education service delivery on the last day of the regular instructional day may be allowed upon making arrangements with the principal or higher designee. Educators will be allowed to leave their assigned duty site immediately after the close of day prior to the beginning of a scheduled holiday period, on Fridays and on days they have been requested in order to work at another site to attend a scheduled evening meeting event, i.e., PTA, holiday program, etc.

Alteration in daily duty day allowed in parent conferencing

10.5 F To the extent that TR resources are available in the amounts specified in Chapter 12, they will be provided for parent-teacher conferences to occur outside of regular school days. Related services will be included in elementary and secondary schools only when TR resources have been reduced due to funding limitations. Building principals may require an accounting of parent-teacher conferences and may otherwise allow necessary alterations as the usual starting and departure times for staff best accommodate parent-teacher conferencing.

Article 10.6

Specific Provisions for Elementary Teachers

Elementary teacher unassigned time periods before & after another day

10.6 A Elementary teachers need periods of unassigned time "on site" for preparation and evaluation of their instructional activities; and should generally be able to count on this time being available on a regular basis. Building principals will make every reasonable effort to best administer the assignment on a teacher's "on-site" unassigned time period before the student day, especially when the subject teacher is working with the class and after the close of the student day.

Elementary related service

10.6 B Certificated employees teaching in an elementary school shall be provided a daily and rotating, multi-rotational fifteen (15) minute relief period unless other suitable arrangements are mutually developed by a building principal and faculty. This provision shall also on an equitable basis apply to teachers of self-contained classes of the special education program.

Weekly average minimum 160 min of unassigned time

10.6 C The District agency is required each grade K-3 classrooms teacher a weekly average of one hundred sixty (160) minutes of unassigned time in four, forty (40) minute blocks of teacher release time. There are times when the classroom teacher may be asked to remain with higher class when a specialist teacher is instructing the class. When this situation occurs the classroom teacher should still be afforded the average of one hundred sixty (160) minutes unassigned time per week.
