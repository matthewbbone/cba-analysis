Uncompensated - Long-Term

6.12 C An authorized uncompensated leave may be allowed to an employee within the following guidelines:

Timely application
April 1 - discretionary leaves
i Approval for a long-term uncompensated leave, e.g., leave for two weeks or more, must normally be presented in writing as far in advance as possible, and prior to April 1 of a school year. If it is of a discretionary nature and will require an "eligible assignment" for a substantial period of time during an ensuing school contract year.

ii The total number of long-term leaves of four-fifths (4/5ths) or more of the days of an ensuing school year which are of a discretionary nature may be limited by the District to three percent (3%) of the staff employed at the current year, exclusive of those granted full year additional leave.

Minimum application information
iii The application for a long-term leave shall include the information cited in Article 6.12 A(i) and above, and a statement of the positions in the District in which the individual would desire to be placed on his/her return from the leave. It must be noted, however that the District's only obligation is to assign an individual to a position for which he/she is qualified.

Contents of long-term leave requests
iv The employee will submit a long-term leave form to the District for approval. The leave form will stipulate the purpose for which the leave is requested, the period covered by the leave, the requirements for the employee to notify the district of his/her intent to return, and a conditional resignation in the event the employee (also to notify the district) fails to return to duty following the end of the leave period. In leave situations covered by law (e.g., military leave and FMLA) the employee's return date will be determined by applicable statute. In all other cases, the employee's return placement will be by an available position for which qualified (Chapter 7, Position Interest Register) unless a position is specifically agreed to on the leave form.

Legal considerations
v An employee on long-term leave of absence must indicate in writing to the Superintendent/Designer by March 1 preceding the school year when he/she is to return from leave or another specific notification date as may have been provided in the leave form that he/she will be returning to the District on the date he/she is obligated to return to duty. Failure to do so will constitute an implied resignation from the District and the employee subsequently reapply for service may be placed in an available vacancy if one exists, but will have otherwise forfeited his/her right to re-employment.

Provisions of termination of long-term leave
vi Requests for an extension of a long-term leave must be received by the District's Superintendent/Designer at least thirty (30) days in advance of the authorized termination date, or no later than March 1 in the case of leaves for a full contract year, except when such compliance is beyond the control of the employee. Extensions of up to one (1) year may be granted. Requests for extensions of a leave of absence must be endorsed by the Superintendent of Schools, presented to the Board for action, and expressed by an addendum to the existing leave contract. Decisions on leave rest with the District.
