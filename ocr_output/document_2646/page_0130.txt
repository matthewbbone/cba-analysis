13.3 B v That the procedures for the selection and assignment of individuals to special assignments vacancies are made known in writing.

13.3 C The District will provide Association members with the opportunity to be considered for each new assignment. The Human Resources Office will post such assignments for a period of five (5) working days and will refer available qualified candidates to the building principal either in advance or along with non-Association candidates.

Article 13.4

Consideration in determining compensation for special assignments
Special assignments cannot always be equal. Certain extended assignments make time demands beyond the usual requirements of all teachers. To compensate for the inherent imbalances in special assignments, factors such as these that follow will be considered in determining whether (1) compensation shall be paid and (2) the level of payment to be made for an activity. The factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance and priority:

13.4 A The estimated median number of hours beyond the regular and required "on site" school-day hours required of all teachers and necessary for an educator to reasonably meet the demands of his/her specific special assignment, or the additional duty days beyond the basic contractual school year.

13.4 B Number of teams, student participants, and adult assistants supervised.

13.4 C Degree of specialized knowledge and experience necessary for the assignment.

13.4 D Equipment and facilities supervision and maintenance responsibilities.

13.4 E Health and safety liability factors inherent in the activity.

13.4 F External public presence immediate and/or potential.

13.4 G Environmental factors, out in weather, etc.

13.4 H The level of payment made for a specific activity should be relevant and competitive with the "prevailing rates of pay" in effect for the same or similar activity in other comparable school districts.

Article 13.5

Rates of compensation for services provided through a supplemental contract:

13.5 A Extra and Co-Curricular Programs. Services will be compensated as provided in the salary schedule of Appendix E which is made a part of this Article by reference.

13.5 B The salary level indicated for each activity is based on (the level) of responsibility as identified within each of the factors in Article 13.4 through a full-scale study conducted at school year 1988-89. Should additional changes be made in the future and/or requirements change, District and the Association will promptly reevaluate the level of compensation scheduled for that activity and make whatever adjustments are necessary in compensation as are fair and equitable within that overall program.
