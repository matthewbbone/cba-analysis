NOTE: A middle school staff may convert certificated classroom teacher position(s) into a certificated teacher for specialized classroom program position(s) on an annual basis. The maximum class size in Article 10.18 C will be increased by the number of students assigned to the overload provision.

The building principal must communicate in writing to the staff how the decision will specifically impact the maximums and when overload provisions will begin. The impacted classrooms shall not be increased by more than one student as a result of this action.

An elementary school staff, with the involvement of the director of elementary education, may convert certificated classroom teacher position(s) into a certificated specialist position(s) on an annual basis at the rate of one (1) specialist only for every seven (7) classroom teachers. The maximum class size in Article 10.18 B will be increased by the number assigned to the School Based Decision-Making Team (SBDMT) decisions.

The building principal must communicate in writing to the staff how the decision will specifically impact the maximums and when overload provisions will begin.

All decisions shall be made by consensus of only those impacted by the decision.

The specialist position(s) shall be in effect for one year and not qualify as a permanent position as defined in Article 7.3 A(1).

Article 10.19

Classroom Overload Relief Guidelines

The provision in Chapter 12 permit teachers to draw against T&I resources when an overload situation exists as a form of compensation, to engage the services of a staff assistant or other certificated teacher for specialized classroom program position(s), and to reduce class size by one student. The principal must consider the impact of overloads on effective instruction, and that such use of T&I resources limits their availability for other uses. The principal will consider the actions listed in Article 10.22 and will involve the administrator for elementary or secondary education and other central office administrators as appropriate.

Overload guidelines shall not be in effect during the first fifteen (15) student attendance days of the school year, and at the beginning of each trimester/semester at the middle/high school level. During the first ten (10) days, and on the earliest day possible, the building administrator will initiate a meeting with each teacher in an overload situation to discuss the problem and explore possible solutions. If the overload cannot be resolved, or an accommodation cannot be reached, the administrator will report the outcome of the meeting to the director of secondary or elementary education with any recommendation(s) for further relief. The building representative will concurrently provide a copy of the report to the Association. The report will be made using the sample format at the end of this chapter.

NOTE: Any staffing enhancement for grades K-12 for classroom overload relief is based on stability of state and local funding. A decrease in funding will alter the staffing enhancement for grades K-12.
