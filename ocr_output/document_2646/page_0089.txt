Conversion Factors: The annual value of one (1) hour of staff assistant time will be computed using the applicable school year hourly rate multiplied times 182 workdays. The certified conversion value will be the average salary based on the state budgeted staff ratio factor multiplied by the FTE amount. In the case of learning support, the certificate conversion value will include the value of accompanying staff essential time.

Example: For school year 2002-03, the staff rate average for a teacher is $45,952 (based on the L801 report), and the hourly rate for a staff assistant is $11.36 (Professional Step plus certification stipend). The yearly cost for one (1) hour of staff assistant time is $2,510 ($11.36 x 182 days). Converting this to FTE would determine equals to 1.43 hours. (SAS 9/29/02 S-317) This is the value of one (1) hour of staff assistant time that accompanies a full 1.0 FTE learning support teacher. Consequently, the total allocation for a 1:2 conversion would be 24.3 hours (18.3 plus 6). All conversions are rounded to the nearest quarter hour. Both the conversion and the accompanying staff assistant time is prorated for less than full FTE.
