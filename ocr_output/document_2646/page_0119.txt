The District or its insurer(s) will reimburse the employee, as obligated by statute, for loss or damage of not less than one ($10) nor more than two-hundred and fifty ($250) dollars to personal property owned while such employees are engaged in (1) the maintenance of order and discipline, or (2) the protection of school personnel, school property, or students.

The District agrees to budget $500 per year for the purpose of reimbursing employees whose personal property, including clothing and automobile, is lost or damaged as a result of theft and vandalism.
