There are Washington Administrative Codes (education and mental health). Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, case law requirements, and other special circumstances that may influence staff configuration and all other factors. If the Association and the District reach an agreement in writing and writes agreement with the impacted certificated staff and building principal, may agree to an alternative delivery model different from those provided in the remainder of this Article (10.24). The District will only act in the absence of such agreement, when essential for legal compliance or equally compelling circumstances. The District will inform the Association in advance of any such action. If the Association receives the notice and does not take action, then the District may not implement the alternative staffing model. In some special education programs, particularly at the secondary level, student attendance can be very sporadic. Consequently, the program enrollment will be determined on a daily average attendance basis across each month.

10.24 A Structured Learning. Structured learning staff allocations are based upon the severity of the population served, the staffing ratios required by mental health WACs for day treatment, available program revenue, and the availability of non district controlled resources as follows:

i All-day treatment programs must be staffed at one (1) mental health provider for every five (5) students. A mental health provider may be either a mental health specialist or a person under the clinical supervision of a mental health specialist.

ii Building-Based Programs - usually one (1) teacher, two (2) assistant teachers, and one (1) mental health specialist (subject to available Title XIX Day Treatment Funds for ten to twelve (10-12) FTE students distributed on an equitable basis as is reasonably possible. Every effort will be made to keep enrollment between ten to twelve (10-12) FTE students.

Additional staff assistant time will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Building-based structured learning program teachers shall have an equivalent planning time which will be provided by scheduling students into other special or regular education classes as determined appropriate by the multi-disciplinary team or by having staff assistants work with students in the classroom while the teacher is planning in another part of the building as allowed by WAC 392-172-474. The principal will have the option to assign to teachers an additional assignment when, due to unforeseen circumstances, the above options cannot be implemented.

Building-based structured learning program teachers are compensated for ten planning periods on a fixed basis in accordance with the structured learning stipend in Appendix E.
