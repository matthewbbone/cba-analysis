CHAPTER 16 - PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

Article 16.1
Professional development
General Administration of the Professional Development Funds.

Concept
16.1 A The District and the Association recognize the imperative that teachers and educational support personnel be life-long learners. To meet this need, each employee must have access to a continuous cycle of professional development, strategically planned to enhance subject matter knowledge, essential learnings, pedagogical practices, personal and professional growth, continuous certification, and District goals and priorities.

16.1 B A continuous cycle of professional development will begin with the employee's self-assessment. Professional development needs identified through this process will be reviewed by the employee's supervisor and form the basis for a plan tailored to individual needs and goals. Individual professional development needs will be made available to the Human Resources Office. The Human Resources Office will use the information so sent in identifying specific opportunities to satisfy the needs of all employees within District, and to determine whether the plans conform with the District's professional development guidelines. Funding of professional development needs may, consistent with Article 16.4 B and 16.5, be from the employee's individual professional development funds, or from other funds made available by the District.

Article 16.2
Optional Professional Development Funds – Appendix E

16.2 A The District will allocate $725 for professional development activities for each FTE. This amount, subject to the availability of funds, is in addition to funding for other TRL categories listed above.

16.2 B Professional development funds will be made available to assist each employee in professional growth activities, such as but not limited to the following:

i Unique individual development needs by the selection of specific course work, attendance at workshops, conferences, and/or,

ii By obtaining training/instruction on a specific instructional skill or knowledge of a curriculum area through merging of other funds with either employee's funds in order to provide for a building staff cooperative workshop.

16.2 C The District will provide the Association with an annual written program performance report summarizing the professional development fund to include total participants, residual funding percentage, and amount of funds remaining (if any) after the residual pay out.

16.2 D The program year for professional development is July 1 – June 30. The District will provide written notice to all certificated employees that claims for professional development that will be completed by June 30 are to be submitted by July 10 for payment against the $725 entitlement and any residual amount.
