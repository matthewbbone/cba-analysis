11.27 C The District will pay the premium for all employees for any specific insurance plan(s) as may be mutually determined by the Association and the District within the limits of Article 11.31 B above. The specific plan benefits and rates of any such plan(s) to cover all employees of the bargaining unit shall become the subject of study by District and Association representatives. The final plan selected—or any proposal for an alteration in benefits or rates during the term of the Agreement—shall be a subject for bargaining between the District and the Association, consistent with Chapter 41.59 RCW. Any portion of the District's contribution not utilized for the mandatory District comprehensive composite rate insurance program may be utilized as authorized by each employee for a health medical plan that he/she has individually selected from those made available to employees. It is understood by the District and the Association that any costs incurred for any such individual selection or use of the optional health insurance offered each employee by the District will be assumed by the employee.

11.27 D The sequence of these deductions will be made in a uniform manner, with the health medical plan selected by the employee to be the last deduction made. Enrollment in a group insurance plan will be normally allowed only within a "traditional open period" (normally September) or within thirty (30) days of employment.

11.27 E Eligibility for participation in an insurance program shall be based on services provided at no less than forty percent (40%) of a full time equivalent (FTE) employee position.

11.27 F Pursuant to legislation of 1990 consolidation of the state's insurance FTE allotment of husband and wife employees in the same bargaining unit or between bargaining units is no longer permitted. One partner will be a single subscriber, the other will assume the costs of any dependents.
