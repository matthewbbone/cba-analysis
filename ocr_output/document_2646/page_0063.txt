CHAPTER 8. EVALUATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE OF CERTIFICATED STAFF

Article 8.1
Annual systematic evaluations
The District and the Association acknowledge that state statute and state principles of school administration require systematic objective assessments, at least annually, of all certificated staff members assigned to permanent positions. Equally important, the District and the Association are committed to the principle that the most effective educators are lifelong learners and that an effective and professional evaluation system is inextricably tied to the professional development process. The evaluation, self-assessment, and observation process is designed to maintain and advance this linkage between evaluation and professional development.

Article 8.2
Priorities of purposes of evaluation
The purposes of evaluation of professional performance in order of priority are deemed to be:

8.2 A To improve the professional performance of the employee.
8.2 B To provide the employee with regular feedback about his/her performance.
8.2 C To specifically inform the employee of ways in which he/she can improve.
8.2 D To identify specific training needs of an employee.
8.2 E To establish a basis for contract renewal or non-renewal, dismissal, or any other disciplinary action against an employee whenever such an action may become necessary.

Article 8.3
Evaluation responsibility
Evaluation is the basic and primary responsibility of the building principal or his/her counterpart in administrative units to whom a certificated person has been assigned. Any principal or other supervisor may request other certificated staff members to assist in the remedy of such identified deficiencies and in strict accordance with written improvement plans as have been specifically designed for a teacher placed on probation. Every certificated employee will be notified of the name of his/her primary evaluator within thirty (30) days of the beginning date of the school year. The summative evaluation responsibility is restricted to persons holding an administrative certificate and serving in that capacity with the District.

Article 8.4
Delegation of evaluation authority
An associate principal and/or another appropriately designated administrator may be assigned by the building principal to perform the evaluative process for designated members of the school's staff.

Article 8.5
Program supervisor evaluation responsibility
For certificated employees assigned to specialized areas of instruction where program supervisors are provided, the program supervisor will assist in the evaluative process giving special attention to the specialized knowledge and technique of the teacher in that assigned area of instruction.
