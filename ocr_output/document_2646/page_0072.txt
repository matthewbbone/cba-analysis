A District level administrator will refer a citizen-parent complaint initiating a complaint at the District level in normal circumstances within three (3) working days of the receipt of said complaint to the level of building administration and/or teacher where the problem originated for full discussion and definition of the issues involved.

Article 9.10

Administrative Discipline Procedures

Disciplining procedures are intended to be constructive procedures to avoid the necessity of dismissal. Conversely, the supervisor or District administrator in appropriate situations may issue a verbal or written caution for incidents not warranting formal disciplinary action but with regard to the discipline process itself. When such a caution is issued, the administrator will follow up within ten (10) working days and provide the employee with written confirmation of the caution and the expected behavior. Such documentation will be retained in the administrator's building file and will not become part of the personnel file.

The parties affirm that the general principle of "progressive discipline" will be applied in correcting employee behavior. The normal sequence of progression is (1) admonishment, (2) letter of reprimand, and (3) suspension. Serious and compelling circumstances may warrant the omission of steps 1-3.

It is in everyone's interest to be both thorough and timely when investigating allegations of misconduct and in communicating the expected, corrected behavior to the employee. It is therefore anticipated that letters of admonishment and reprimand will normally be issued within ten (10) working days of when the misconduct becomes known except when District and/or Association representatives require additional time to properly complete the investigation and review process.

9.10 A  Admonishment. The employee's supervisor, or a District level administrator in appropriate situations, shall have the option to admonish verbally or in writing by identifying the behavior that needs correction. Admonishments are to be issued for minor incidents.

i. An administrator may admonish an employee for misconduct that, if continued, may result in progressive discipline. Attendance at an admonishment conference is normally limited to the administrator and the employee. However, the employee must be informed prior to or at the start of the meeting that it is for the purpose of an admonishment. The employee, on his/her initiative, may request a delay of not more than one weekday to arrange to have another person present. When an employee representative is to be present, a District office representative may also participate.

ii. A letter of admonishment will be retained in the administrator's file. The letter shall be signed by the recipient, indicating only that he/she has seen it and does not necessarily indicate he/she agrees with the content. A copy of the letter will be provided to the educator.
