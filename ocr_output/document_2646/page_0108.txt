11.4 C Special procedures for approval for recognition of course credit not covered in the articles in this chapter.

In the event of extraordinary circumstances wherein an individual educator has earned college credits(s) which appears to be relevant to his/her professional development with the District but does not qualify under the articles in this chapter, the Superintendent will approve arrangements on the occupational basis of the salary schedule. Procedures for consideration of college credits are as follows:

i The individual educator will make a written application on forms provided to higher immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will review, approve, or disapprove, the application, forward it to the Human Resources Office for review and forward it to the appropriate administrator. The Human Resources Office will determine if the courses are acceptable for recognition by OSPI regulations in the determining of the staff characteristics index figure for the District.

ii If the application is disapproved by both the immediate supervisor and the appropriate administrator, the application will be returned to the applicant as the final disposition of the request. If the immediate supervisor and/or the appropriate administrator approves the application, the application will be submitted to the Superintendent/Designee.

iii The Superintendent/Designee will review the application with the commentary of the supervisor, Human Resources Office, and administrator and make a final determination on the application to grant or reject the course(s) for purposes of District salary schedule placement.

Vocational education teacher placement

11.5 A Persons to be employed in vocationally accredited assignments will have a proper certificate with appropriate apprenticeship training and work experience computed at two (2) years of apprenticeship for one (1) year of academic credit and evaluated as being equivalent to a year of undergraduate academic education up to and including the Bachelor's Degree. Years of experience utilized for academic credit for placement on the schedule may not also be utilized for years of experience credit in advance down the salary scale.

11.5 B Advancement in salary range for a non-degree vocational educator teacher may be recommended or initiated by the Superintendent/Designee, with a favorable endorsement by the Superintendent, for submission to the Board of Directors for action to place him/her on the higher salary lane. Normally, such placement will be based on appropriate training and/or experience granted in lieu of college credit as may meet the development of special qualifications for a particular assignment. Placement is further governed by the provisions of WAC 180-77 and Basic Education Reporting criteria (5927c).
