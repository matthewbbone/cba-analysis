9.6 D An employee's public expression must be free of false and recklessly made statements. Employees will use the District's communication services in a manner that is factual, fair, and respectful.

9.6 E The District has a duty to investigate prior to any disciplinary action of an employee.

The Association and the District agree that these guidelines should not be considered as absolutes. They are based on specific court decisions, and the courts continue to define First Amendment Rights as they relate to the public concern. Whether any given speech is protected or how much protection will be afforded an individual depends on the unique circumstances of each case.

Article 9.9

Responding to Parent/Community Complaints

Prompt participation in supervisor-conducted conferences questioning competency required
An educator in normal circumstances will be informed within three (3) working days of conferences or contacts, including anonymous complaints, between parents or citizens and his/her supervisor when there are discussions of events or circumstances that are relative to an evaluation of his/her professional performance and competency. The teacher and the administrator will meet and consult on how best to address the complaint. It is recognized that each initiative may result in different outcomes and teacher communication is typically the first step of resolving differences. Different approaches will be considered consistent with the nature of the complaint, level of emotion, or overall atmosphere. No written reference to an alleged complaint from a citizen shall be included in the educator's personnel file unless it is verified through investigation and becomes part of a disciplinary action and the teacher is notified in the prescribed manner.
