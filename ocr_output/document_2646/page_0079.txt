The following priorities will be utilized: (1) days at the end of the school year; (2) spring in-service day, if available; (3) mid-semester weekday; (4) spring holiday days only in extreme situations.

Delayed day reporting time
10.2 C Whenever the Superintendent delays a reporting time of students to keep school buses out of the morning rush hour traffic during especially inclement weather, employees will be expected to report to their assigned buildings at their usual starting times (Article 10.5 D) or as reasonably near thereto as is consistent with their safety and in no case later than thirty (30) minutes prior to the opening of school for students as required in WAC 180-44-050.
