CHAPTER 5. GRIEVANCE PROCESSING PROCEDURES

Article 5.2
Purpose & limits of use of grievance procedure
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide the procedures which will secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, solutions to complaints of employees in an expeditious and economical manner. These procedures are not intended to be, and may not be, utilized by an employee or the Association as an avenue to obtain a right, privilege, or advantage in the conditions of employment that was not previously provided by the Board in the Comprehensive Professional Agreement, Board policy, administrative regulation, or other administrative directive or past practice.

Article 5.3
Association representation responsibilities
Pursuant to RCW 41.29. Section 10, the Association shall be required to represent all the employees within the bargaining unit in the processing of their grievances without regard to their membership in the Association, provided that any employee at any time may present a complaint through regular administrative channels outside of the negotiated grievance processing procedures and have such complaint adjusted without the intervention of the Association. However, the Association must receive written notice of a statement of the nature of the complaint be afforded an opportunity to be present at all meetings where the adjustment is made from the date of the issuance of the adjustment made, which adjustment shall not be inconsistent with any of the terms of the Comprehensive Professional Agreement then in effect.
