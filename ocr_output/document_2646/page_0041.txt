Compensated Short-Term Leaves

Article 6.11

Personal Business Leave Day, Compensated

Basic rationale for leave(s)

The parties recognize that an employee may need to absent himself/herself from assigned duties during the regular school day and school year to handle matters of personal business, to carry out leadership roles in non-school connected community organizations, to attend special family events, and other similar matters of significance. The District affirms that its employees should play an active role in the community without undue personal penalties or sacrifices.

Basic constraints

6.11 A A personal business leave will be afforded to an employee to attend to matters of bona fide importance not easily feasible to handle outside regular hours. The nature of the problem should be an urgent need, but lack the clear elements of the immediate risk that would normally qualify as a disaster or emergency and qualify for emergency leave. The business should be a matter of bona fide necessity and importance and not mere convenience. The scheduling of the activity should be beyond the control of the employee. It is not intended to be used as a free-floating personal holiday and/or for the intentional extension of a holiday period or weekend for social and recreational purposes.

Situations of emergency not emergency

6.11 B Approval or disapproval of personal leave requests will be made by the immediate supervisor. Personal leave requests will be decided on their merits as outlined above and not based on whether the District or the employee bears the cost of the substance. The basis for disapproving personal leave will be provided in writing by the supervisor to the employee.

Scheduling not solely controlled by employee
