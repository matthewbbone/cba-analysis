Notification & verification procedure

Employees, upon finding it necessary to be absent from their assigned duties by reason of illness, injury, or emergency, will report their absence through the District's automated system. When an absence is expected to last more than one day, or when the estimated length of leave is unknown, the employee will notify his/her building principal or other immediate supervisor at the earliest possible time, giving the reason so that effective planning can take place for the longer period of absence. Upon return to duty, an employee will be required to sign an absence report stating therein the reason(s) for reported absence. In cases where a series of days of illness, injury, or emergency for a consecutive period of more than five (5) working days, or in cases where the supervisor has cautioned the employee on excessive use of leave, the reason for the absence must be certified to by an attending physician or other competent authority as determined by the District.
