ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS FOR VANCOUVER SCHOOL DISTRICT AND VANCOUVER EDUCATION ASSOCIATION

Introduction: The Vancouver School District and the Vancouver Education Association are long-term partners in the delivery of quality education. In carrying out their joint mission, there are occasions when disagreements arise. The Comprehensive Professional Agreement provides a grievance procedure for resolving disagreements regarding matters covered by the Agreement including:

1) Interpretation or application of the terms of a regulation, rule, or practice;
2) Inequitable treatment of an employee;
3) Existence of a condition that jeopardizes employees health or safety.

The District also has regular administrative channels that Association members may use for resolving certain other disagreements.

However, both the District and the Association have recently realized that disputes may arise that fall outside the Agreement and are not sufficiently covered by other resolution processes. It is their desire to develop an efficient and cost-effective process for jointly attempting to resolve these disputes locally, while still protecting their rights to take the dispute to the Public Employment Relations Commission, or to any other body having jurisdiction, if the local process is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute. The report analyzes all of the options and recommends such a process.

Recommendation: In reviewing the available options, assisted negotiation using a neutral third party acceptable to both sides seems to be the best choice for all disputes, regardless of the subject and regardless of the settlement attempts up to that point. Assisted negotiation involves the parties in solving their own dispute, is less formal and less costly, and is generally better accepted than a decision rendered by an outside third party. The recommended process is explained in detail in the Recommended Process section of this appendix.

The recommendation protects the rights of the parties to refer the dispute to other authorities if this local resolution process is unsuccessful. It also provides that the parties may mutually agree to stop the process at any point, but may not unilaterally proceed to the next legal option without first exhausting all efforts in assisted negotiation.

The recommendation recognizes that the District and the Association are long-term partners in the provision of quality education, and that they need a flexible process to resolve disputes falling outside of the Agreement and the administrative processes. It provides an amicable dispute resolution process that is critical to the parties' long-term relationship. It also recognizes that no two disputes are the same, and that it is important to make every effort to help the parties reach their own solution and to keep the process as informal as possible.

The process might also be appropriate for either party to use in resolving other disputes.
