The District/Building PG and IEP teams will consider four (4) factors in considering placement for mainstreaming/inclusion of a special education student into a regular education program:

10.30 A The educational benefits available to the student in a regular classroom, supplemented with appropriate aids and services, as compared with the educational benefits of a special education classroom;

10.30 B The non-academic benefits of interaction with children who are not disabled;

10.30 C The potentially negative effect of the student's presence on the teacher and other students in the classroom; and

10.30 D The cost of mainstreaming/inclusion into a regular classroom.

For students with disabilities the Professional Group (PG) is responsible for determining appropriate supplemental aids and services to address instructional needs. Distribution of staff assistant time assigned by the PG for a student shall be communicated to all teachers assigned for instruction of that student.

If the student with disabilities is seriously disruptive, distracting, or unruly, and there is a detriment to other students' learning, or if the student with disabilities takes a substantially inordinate portion of the teacher's time, such that other students' learning is negatively impacted, the PG shall be reconvened to discuss alternative strategies or placements.

Each building Site-Based Decision-Making Team (SBDMT) shall develop a written site plan stipulating the procedures to be followed in placing a student with significantly unique needs into a regular classroom for mainstreaming or inclusion purposes. The plan shall be reviewed for legal compliance by the District. This plan will be communicated to the staff at the beginning of each academic year.

Each building administrator with the assigned responsibility of supervision of the PG shall ensure an equitable distribution of special education students among regular classrooms deemed appropriate by the PG. In doing so, items one through four (4) above must be addressed.

When a student who has a life-threatening health condition which may require emergency procedures is placed in any program, all staff involved will be fully informed in writing of said emergency procedures.
