Secondary recording & submitting grades

10.7 E For formal grade reporting, high school teachers will not be required to make written evaluations more than twice (2) times each semester and middle school teachers will not be required to make written evaluations more than two (2) times each quarter. Secondary teachers, or any teacher utilizing data processing procedures for reporting to parents, will be allowed up to a total of five (5) working days following the end of each designated report period to record and to submit report sheets to the building administrator's office, covering the mid-year and final report periods in the first semester (10.7 C), or the second semester if the day has been provided for that purpose. All grade reporting procedures prescribed by the District shall be designed to avoid requiring teachers to work weekends to complete the task to meet the District-set deadlines.

To the extent that TRI resources are available in the amounts specified in Chapter 12, high school leaders are expected to be available outside the normal school day for purposes of parent-conferencing.

Middle schools

10.7 F To the extent that TRI resources are available in the amounts specified in Chapter 12, middle school parent-teacher conferences will occur outside the normal school day. Release time will be used only when the amount of TRI resource has been reduced due to funding limitations.

10.7 G Teachers shall not be required to utilize a prep period for making student attendance supervision telephone calls. (Teachers may make calls on a voluntary basis.)

Camp-In (Sixth Grade)

10.7 H The District shall establish the camp experiences for all middle school students which shall be uniform for all schools. All camps will be scheduled on student attendance days. Compensation shall be at the approved hourly rate. During the regular school day, staff members may attend other duties during the afternoon and one-half (1/2) hour work day. Staff members who would experience personal hardship shall not be required to attend camp-in programs that require being away from home overnight. Teachers participating in the camp experience are entitled to compensation for up to ten (10) hours of student supervision outside the normal teaching day and an additional five (5) hours of advance preparatory time at the approved hourly rate.
