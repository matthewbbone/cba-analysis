Article 6.13

District Budget Crisis Leave—Uncompensated (See Chapter 14)

Purpose of leave

6.13 A During a period of a District budget crisis such as a double levy failure, substantial reduction of state or federal funding, a significant drop in student enrollment, or a similar substantial change in projected funding of the District, a District budget crisis leave will be granted to each certificated employee named for non-renewal or dismissal as may apply at such leave.

Usual application dates

6.13 B These leaves will be provided without regard to the normal March 1 application date and the stated reasons of District convenience because of a budget crisis. An employee named for non-renewal will not be considered for reappointment during the period of leave, nor will an employee named for dismissal be eligible for reinstatement or return to employment with the District when a vacancy occurs for a regular assignment. The employee will file an appeal from the non-renewal/dismissal notice simultaneously with a request for a District budget crisis leave. Upon approval of the leave, the appeal will be dropped.

Nature of consideration offered for a leave

6.13 C Individuals taking leave during a period of District budget crisis will not be prohibited from accepting gainful employment, enrolling in advanced education programs, or traveling during the leave period and shall not be terminated for that reason except on written request of the employee.

Immediate availability during crisis year not required

Leave extensions for a continuing crisis situation

6.13 D Leaves granted because of such crisis situations will normally be renewed annually upon timely request if crisis circumstances continue to prevail beyond the initial year for which the leave was granted. Application for renewal of budget crisis leaves must be submitted by May 15 of each year.

Partial year reassignments in crisis years

6.13 E Individuals accepting leave during a period of District crisis and desiring reinstatement to a partial year active assignment, should a vacancy appear for which they are qualified, will request continuing active application status for those positions and will be reasonably placed according to Chapter 7, the Professional Placement provisions of this Agreement.
