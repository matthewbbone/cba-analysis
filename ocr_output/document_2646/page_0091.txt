10.17 F Teachers in such classes may request an overload conference, consistent with Article 10.19, when they feel that the above factors need to be addressed.

Article 10.18

Class Size Determinations

10.18 A The number of students in a class is impacted by the number of certified staff assigned and positions other than classroom teachers, i.e., selected time periods allowed to teachers such as department heads, cafeteria control, and the number of professionals in support positions such as media specialists, reading specialists, traveling teachers, counselors, nurses, drug and alcohol program facilitators, etc.

10.18 B Elementary Individual Classroom Maximum and Secondary Student-Teacher Maximum Daily Contacts

i) Grades K–3—A maximum of twenty-four (24) students is established.
ii) Grades 4–5—A maximum of twenty-seven (27) students is established.

10.18 C Middle School—The middle school staffing levels shall be 24:16 (students/teacher) for basic education students.

i) This ratio is intended to result in maximum class sizes of 28:1 in a seven (7) period day and 29:1 in a six (6) period day.
ii) Any classes, other than music (band and choral groups) and physical education, that exceed these sizes will require review by the principals, VEA, and District administration.

iii) Overload situations shall be addressed as provided in Article 10.22.

10.18 D High School—The maximum number of student-teacher daily contacts is based on thirty (30) times the number of classes a teacher is required to teach in his/her duty day. No teacher will be assigned more than one (1) instructional period per semester in excess of thirty-two (32) students.

Special education students shall be figured in calculating the basic education class sizes when these students are receiving instruction from the basic educational teachers.

10.18 E The first option to meeting the provisions of Article 10.18 is to balance the class sizes in all buildings in accordance with Article 10.18 B. To meet the unique needs of students in a school, deviations from the class size provided in B ii) may occur. For example, K-3 elementary teachers agree that one teacher will teach four classes and the other three classes in order to avoid a combination classroom arrangement. When a deviation occurs, the reasons for the deviation shall be agreed to in writing by the affected teacher(s) and principal. The form provided at the end of this chapter must be completed and copies sent to the Association and the administrator for elementary or secondary education within three (3) days of the decision to deviate.
