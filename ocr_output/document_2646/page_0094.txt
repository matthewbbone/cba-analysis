When the above options cannot be accomplished within available resources, the District will continue to monitor the overload situation and take action at the first opportunity to eliminate the overload. The principal is responsible for assuring that teachers are treated equitably with regard to overload situations (i.e. the teacher will not be subjected to repeated overloads in successive years when other teachers have no overload).

Additional boundary exceptions will not generally be approved for a building with an overload situation if the additional boundary exception would aggravate the existing overload situation within the building or would eliminate an opportunity to reduce the overload. However, the District and the Association recognize that increased enrollment through boundary exceptions may be the best solution to enrollment and overload issues.

An additional, full or part-time teacher will be employed wherever the aggregate overload within a building equals a normal class size or student-teacher contact level.

Guidelines for Elementary Combination Class Formation & Operation

The parties acknowledge that the age patterns of students enrolling in each of the elementary schools of the District are sometimes distorted at specific levels. Consequently, combination classes are often necessary. Combination classes do create some particular problems that should be recognized and dealt with toward the goal of creating the best teaching/learning environment possible.

It is expected that all the teachers—most recent instructional regular classroom teachers and instructional teaching classroom teachers—will be invited by building administrators to fully participate in discussions regarding the initial formation and subsequent operation of a combination class particularly as they may pertain to their work duties and responsibilities and having a reasonable "manageable task." After all input is gathered, the final decision will remain with the principal to ensure the best learning/teaching environment possible.

10.23 A In the selection of a teacher for a combination class, it is very desirable that the teacher be:

i) A volunteer for the assignment, if possible,

ii) Preferably a teacher with prior experience with the curriculum of at least one (1) of the grades included in the combination class; and

iii) Not the same teacher utilized as a combination grade teacher for two (2) or more consecutive years unless that is a desired assignment of the specific teacher, and/or if no other teacher is available per grade level.

10.23 B In the evaluation of a teacher in a combination class, the evaluator should:

i) Take into account the particular difficulties of the assignment; and

ii) Include recognition of successful management of the assignment in the "commendations" portion of the evaluation form.
