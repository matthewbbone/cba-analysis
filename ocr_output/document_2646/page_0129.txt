CHAPTER 13. SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS UNDER SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRACTS

Article 13.1
Noncompensated but have responsibility for student activities
All educators, as professional staff members of a faculty, are expected to provide a certain measure of professional services that will contribute to the survival program, to the guidance program, and to the good climate and efficient operation of their school without additional compensation beyond that provided in their Basic Contract: Certificated Staff on the Professional Salary Schedule.

Article 13.2
Supplemental contracts required.
The District and the Association acknowledge that state statute RCW 28A.67.074 provides that, "No certificated employee shall be required to perform duties not described in the contract unless a new or supplemental contract is made, except that in an unexpected emergency the Board of Trustees or School District administration may require the employee to perform other reasonable duties on a temporary basis," and further that "no supplemental contract shall be subject to the continuing contract provision of Title 28A or 28B."

Article 13.3
Supplemental contracts issued for special assignments
13.3 A Therefore, annually, any teacher requested to perform a duty not normally assigned to teachers will be issued a supplementary contract stipulating the duties to be performed in that special assignment and the compensation to be paid, and which the educator has agreed to accept for the coming year. The contract form is attached in Appendix D, and made a part of this Article by reference.

Guidelines for selection & assignment of personnel to special activities
13.3 B District and building administrators responsible for selecting staff for special assignments (both paid and unpaid) must make every reasonable effort to see:

i That the duties of non-paid special assignments parallel the responsibilities as outlined in WAC 182-44-010

ii That the special assignments are equitably distributed among the staff so each faculty member carries his/her fair share. If the building principal and a majority of the teachers in a building approve, the Association faculty representative shall not be assigned such duties.

iii That equal opportunities are to be extended to staff to obtain compensation for special assignments requiring a teaching contract. The order of consideration for the assignment of personnel to obtain the services of the best-qualified people for paid special assignments shall be first within the building, second within the District, and third outside of the District. The Human Resources Officer shall provide the opportunity for each certificated staff member to declare higher interest in assigned duties. A list of all available positions from the District will be provided to each principal to be utilized in filling positions when an qualified certificated staff member is available from the building.

iv That the preferences of the certificated staff members for particular assignments are considered in making assignments.
