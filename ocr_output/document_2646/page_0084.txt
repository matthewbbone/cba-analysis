Article 10.7

Specific Provisions for Secondary Teachers

Daily prep period
10.7 A Full-time secondary classroom teachers will be provided one (1) teaching period each day for a preparation and evaluation period.

Secondary prescription of prep periods
10.7 B Teachers need a period for the preparation and evaluation of their instructional activities and must be able to commit this time being available on a regular basis. When substitute teachers are unavailable the following provisions apply:

i The principal may preempt a teacher's planning period which will be compensated at the approved hourly rate (permitted in the length of the planning period). This provision does not apply to building-based enhanced learning program teachers who receive benefits as per Appendix 5, for least of planning periods.

ii Teachers who are employed 5 or less may be requested to substitute the remainder of the day at the substitute rate of pay.

iii Teachers who are employed more than 5 and less than 10 may substitute for no more than one hour at the approved hourly rate of the preempted portion thereof. Teachers in this category who choose to substitute for more than one hour must do so at the substitute rate of pay for the entire period (i.e., they may not request one hour at the approved hourly rate and additional hours at the substitute rate).

iv There is no additional compensation for situations in which teachers must "double up" to cover an absent teacher's class. The District and building principal have an obligation to make every possible effort to employ a substitute teacher or take other action to avoid the need for doubling up.

Open campus
10.7 C A teacher shall be permitted to leave the "work site" during his/her lunch period, subject to reasonable requirements for notifying the office of his/her departure and return. A teacher may be permitted to leave the work site during his/her preparation period with permission from the building principal or higher designee.

Course prep commitments
10.7 D Every reasonable effort will be made to keep the number of subject fields and different curriculum course assignments for a secondary (9-12) teacher's assignment at a minimum. Generally, the normal teaching assignment is deemed to be no more than three (3) preparations and two (2) different subject fields. When involuntary expanded assignments are necessary, the building principal will discuss the circumstances and reasons for expanded assignments with the staff members involved.
