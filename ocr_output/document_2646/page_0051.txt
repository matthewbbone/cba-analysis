7.3 B v.e.
Position Definitions. The District will normally define positions at a minimum of forty percent (40%). This will qualify an individual for the opportunity to obtain teacher insurance benefits. (Example: Two (2) individuals sharing a position of five (5) teaching periods would be computed as one (1) sixty percent (60%) teacher with benefits and one (1) teacher with forty percent (40%) of the benefits.)

vi. Protected Positions. The Association has reluctantly acknowledged that the District must assign qualified personnel to certain co- and extracurricular student programs to ensure they will be of good quality. Consequently, an individual of little District seniority that has the necessary qualifications to handle both a co- and extracurricular assignment as well as a regular curriculum assignment can obtain a preferred assignment in the staffing of a school. A person with much experience in a particular activity or other qualification, competence and/or desire to serve in a co/extracurricular activity assignment is at risk to be reassigned. The administrative prerogative to assign individuals of little seniority in protected co-/extracurricular "protected" positions should be kept to a critical few situations. Conflicted staff members placed into the latter (3) classes of positions in a building as identified below are protected from an involuntary reassignment caused by the reduction of staff in a building.

v.i.a. Staff assigned because of established affirmative action program staffing objectives, ethnic minority, etc.

v.i.b. Staff assigned to co-curricular extended-day activities by virtue of their curriculum teaching assignment, which are middle school and high school vocal and instrumental, high school journalism and yearbook, high school drama and stage.

v.i.c. Intramural director in middle schools.

Transfers 7.3 C
Transfer refers essentially to a change in place (e.g., building or administrative unit) where services are performed. An administrative unit excess when all like certified employees are managed and supervised under a central administration (e.g., counseling, psychology, vision and performing arts, music teachers), and the same teacher is not hired elsewhere.

Designation of identical employee groups as administrative units is subject to mutual agreement of the Association and the District. Employees in an administrative unit are considered as being assigned to the unit and not to a specific location. However, prior to reassignment of employees within an administrative unit, the employees will be given notice of the basis for the proposed reassignment and provided an opportunity to have their input considered as part of a final decision.

Reassignment 7.3 D
Reassignment: Reassignment refers to a change in a "position," i.e., new grade level, subject matter, administrative position (with or without transfer to another place).

Opening 7.3 E
Opening: An opening in a position exists when no currently employed certificated person has been formally assigned to fill it.
