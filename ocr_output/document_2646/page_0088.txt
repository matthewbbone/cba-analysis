Number of state & local funded positions in District budget

The legislature funds through the Basic Education Act (BEA) one (1) FTE classified position for each three (3) FTE BEA certified positions. This ratio of one-to-three (1:3) includes all classified positions, i.e., clerical, custodial, technical, and the professional staff at staff, at the teaching and District level. The administration and food service positions are not included as are determined necessary for the basic operations of the District's BEA programs. Staff assistants are employed primarily from those funds that are generated by the regular passage of the local special school levy and that are not being utilized for the employment of additional certified staff to lower class size or for other specified purpose in the enhancement of the BEA program.

Staff assistant assigned guidelines 10.12 D
The following priority guidelines shall generally govern the allotment of available elementary staff assistant time by the District among the elementary schools and within a school by the principal, i.e., exclusive of categorically funded state and federal programs:

i. In priority, safety patrol activities.
ii. 2nd priority - playground and cafeteria supervision
iii. 3rd priority - assignment of staff assistants to classroom and other instructional areas to assist in clerical and instructional activities with teachers and students.

v.a. Excessive enrollment in a room. It is agreed that, in instances where it is not possible to utilize elementary classrooms, staff assistant time will be provided, if available, to offer a measure of relief.
v.b. Basic school program - instructional activities area

Staff assistant utilization 10.12 E
The specific quantity of staff assistant utilization within an elementary school will be determined by the school principal after consultation with the certificated staff in the school.

10.12 F
The intent is to staff classified positions with qualified certificated personnel. When it is not possible to recruit a qualified certificated employee or if it is not practical due to other limitations, the certificated allocation may be converted to classified time. Conversion of time will be based on the district's average certified salary plus accompanying classification support per 10 certified FTE at the elementary and secondary level). Upon the assignment of the converted hours to a staff assistant, the principal will notify Human Resources and VEA simultaneously via e-mail. The conversion formula will be published in each annual letter of agreement.
