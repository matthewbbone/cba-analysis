7.3 A iii Head Teacher/Program Coordinator Positions: A position that requires administrative and supervisory responsibilities (exclusive of summative evaluation) and that is filled from the teacher bargaining unit. (See Article 7.15)

7.3 B Assignment: Assignment is the placement of an individual in an open position. Assignments are classified as:

i Standard Assignments: The placement of an employee serving on a continuing or provisional basis contract of employment into a permanent position opening.

ii Acting Assignment: The placement of a teacher into a position—usually permanent position—for not more than one (1) school year. Permanent positions and new contracts for open positions are based on an acting assignment “basis” if the notice offered is first fifteen (15) school days of the school year. As an exception, an employee hired into a position during the first fifteen (15) school days which was a known vacancy at the end of the previous school year and for which PIR candidates were available will be in an acting assignment. An “acting assignment” experience may not be used as a qualification requirement.

iii Replacement Teacher—Thus Certain Assignments: The placement of a contracted employee into a permanent or temporary position on a replacement for a continuing contract teacher on a substitutical, regular, or other leave (RCW 28A.405.900). The replacement may not necessarily serve in the same position vacated by the individual on leave. (This classification was previously referred to as delegate assignment. Replacement teachers will receive the same benefits as all other teachers.)

iv Casual day substitute assignment: The daily on-call employment of an employee in a variety of different positions, or the placement of an employee in a specific position for a period of not more than twenty (20) days. Such employment does not confer benefits, and will be paid at the Board approved daily rate regardless of the aggregate number of days employed by that individual during any 10 day’s given year. Exceptions to place the employee at a scheduled rate may be made by the Administrator of Human Resources when necessary to meet the needs of the District.

v Term Substitute Assignment

va. The placement of a substitute into a position for a period of time that is contemplated to be potentially more than twenty (20) work days but less than ninety-one (91) days.
