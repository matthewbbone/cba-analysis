Article 8.6

Evaluation process year-long cycle

Evaluation and professional development are conceived as processes that are continuous, normally planned, and conducted throughout an employee's career with the District. Although yearly evaluations are required by statute and critical points of accountability may become prominent in the cycle, these will not be viewed as isolated incidents, but rather as integral functions in the continuous cycle.

Article 8.7

Building principals, associate principals, and other responsible supervisors will plan and schedule as part of the annual pre-school staff activities an explanatory presentation and appropriate discussion of the evaluation process, including quality time for reviewing and practicing feedback on the certified employee's work performance. Certificated employees will take initiative to allow their professional development both in the selection of observations and in seeking evaluation input. Mutual assessment and input to identify developmental needs and opportunities are essential ingredients of the process. The scheduling of observations should be discussed, i.e., teacher initiated and/or administrator initiated, to provide for the most effective development of the evaluation process. Information obtained through scheduled observations should be supplemented by other methods of evaluation and through the use of input that the employee may choose to provide.

Article 8.8

Annual evaluation reports due

Every certificated employee will be evaluated annually and an official report of that evaluation on the appropriate form shall be filed in the Human Resources Office. Evaluation reports on all certificated employees must be filed in the Human Resources Office no later than twenty (20) school days before the end of the year.

Article 8.9

New employee evaluation time dimensions

The 1992 Legislature established an initial two-year (2) period of time for teachers new to teaching in Washington State as a "probationary contract" time to demonstrate satisfactory performance period prior to permanent or "certificated" status. During the initial two years (2) and each subsequent year, the employee will be evaluated at least once, for thirty (30) minutes within ninety (90) days of the beginning date of the employee's service (first day of employment) and preliminary reports are due in the Human Resources Office no later than one hundred and five (105) calendar days from the employee's beginning date of service. In the event the employee does not make sufficient progress toward improvement during an established probationary period, he/she will be separated from service with the District as is provided in statute.

Article 8.10

Preliminary report

For all certificated employees whose performance is judged to be unsatisfactory, a report stating the probable cause or reasons for probation will be submitted to the Superintendent and a copy provided to the employee. The principal or designated evaluation supervisor and the employee shall immediately attempt to develop a mutually agreeable written plan designed to improve the employee's effectiveness in the identified deficient areas. If the supervisor and employee are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable plan for improvement, the supervisor shall prepare and deliver such plan to the employee. Such reports will include a recommended, specific, and reasonable program designed to assist the employee in improving further performance.
