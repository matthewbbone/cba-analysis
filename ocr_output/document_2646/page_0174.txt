4. The parties should agree on time frames for resolution of the dispute:
   a) If the parties cannot agree, the recommendation of the mediator will be used.
   b) The parties jointly, or the mediator, have the flexibility to adjust the time frames if progress warrants it.

5. The mediator will use conciliation, facilitation, and mediation in attempting to help the parties resolve the dispute:
   a) The mediator will meet with the parties individually and together as progress warrants.
   b) The mediator will advise the parties honestly and make suggestions as appropriate to assist in the resolution process.
   c) The mediator may consult with outside experts in the subject area of the dispute and may call in an outside expert to assist the process with neutral evaluation or fact finding.
   d) If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the mediator may:
      1) Privately analyze with each party the strengths and weaknesses of its case.
      2) Recommend a solution and work to move the parties toward acceptance of the solution, but the recommendation is not binding on the parties.
   e) Negotiations will continue until the dispute is resolved or until all parties agree that further negotiations are fruitless.

6. If the parties reach agreement, they must also agree on whether the decision is precedent setting for all similar future disputes, or is a one-time solution.

7. If appropriate, the agreement may include provisions for monitoring the progress of the solution over time, with the mediator acting as the monitor at agreed upon intervals and reporting back to the parties. If the mediator finds the solution is not working, he or she may recommend to the parties that they reconvene and attempt to improve the solution.

8. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute despite the best efforts of assisted negotiation, the mediator will discuss with both parties the ramifications of not reaching agreement and the options available to them to resolve the dispute.

9. The parties may mutually agree to stop this process at any point, but they may not unilaterally stop the process and move directly to the Public Employment Relations Commission, or any other outside body, without first exhausting all efforts in assisted negotiation.

10. Both parties will bear their own costs through all steps of the process and will share equally in the cost of the mediator and all outside costs of the resolution process.
