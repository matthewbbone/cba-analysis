Article 15.3

Each SBDMT will be comprised of two (2) kinds of members:

Active
An active member is an individual who personally chooses to become involved in all of the processes necessary in the study and planning as well as the implementation aspects of all the activities involved in the identification and achievement of an instructional goal. These persons are willing to remain on site beyond the routine "on-site" seven and one-half hour (7 1/2) day, to advise the management/leadership program, following approved program guidelines. Active members have by self-determination and declaration identified themselves as active participants.

The principal and co-chairs will organize these persons into committees, the number and size of committees as is appropriate to meet the needs of the instructional issues of the site they serve. The name, time, and place of meetings shall be determined mainly by the co-chair or chair for each committee. Every reasonable effort will be made to provide equitable opportunity for involvement of each member of the group. Sub-committee chairs will schedule meetings as mutually determined by members of the committees. Disputes over whether a proposed decision is subject to site-based decision-making will be referred to the Association and the District for resolution.

Passive
A passive member is an individual who chooses to play no significant role in the study and planning of a school improvement planning process. Passive members shall be included in the review of proposed plans and in all consensus building activities relative to the approval and implementation of the plan.

Article 15.6

Levels of agreement
The decision-making process shall include open dialogue in which issues are presented, defined, discussed, and resolved. This shall be a process in which those affected by a decision participate directly or through a representative process. The following levels of agreement are in the order of priority:

Consensus
15.6 A Every reasonable effort will be made to reach instructional decisions of the team by consensus. Consensus is when a decision has been agreed to by all members, active and passive. All members have an understanding of the reasoning leading to the decision and will support the decision. Example: Five-to-five method, all participants show five's. This would be the same as a 100% agreement.

Sufficient consensus
15.6 B Each member, active and passive, may not completely agree with the decision, but shall feel that they have had their information and opinions heard, that their views have been considered, and that now all will abide by the group decision and support its implementation. Example: Four-to-five method, participants range in agreement from 1-5, but no fives are indicated.

Voting
15.6 C When it has been determined by the co-chairs that consensus cannot be achieved, proposals may be submitted for a vote to only those members of the faculty who are impacted by the vote. The rationale regarding who should have voting rights and who will not is established by the decision team. The issue will be referred to the co-chairs and VBA building representatives for resolution by consensus. When votes are taken, 100% approval is required by all sites. Each Site-Based Decision-Making Team may increase the percentage necessary for approval due to its unique
