9.10 B A Letter of Reprimand

Written reprimand for the record procedure

i An administrator with the assigned responsibility for the evaluation of a specified educational person may, for just and sufficient cause, issue a letter of reprimand for the individual to be retained filing the letter in the file of the reprimanded, the behavior required in the future, and the probable consequences if there is a repetition of the behavior cited. Such a letter may also be issued by a District level administrator in appropriate situations.

Causes for a reprimand

ii A letter of reprimand may be issued for an incident when no error of judgment or negligence that may reasonably be construed to have placed in jeopardy the mental and physical health and safety of a person entrusted to higher care, an act of moral turpitude; an overt refusal to carry out a lawful administrative directive, or refusal to abide by rules and regulations. District reprimands will be issued. A reprimand will be placed on file in the Human Resources Office within two (2) days following its issue. The reprimand will remain in the individual's District personnel record until such time as it may be removed at the direction of the Superintendent/designee, or the effect of the Superintendent.

Recorded reprimand procedure

iii Any educator whose behavior may be subject to reprimand shall be allowed to know all of the facts then known supporting an allegation that there is probable, just, and sufficient cause for such action. A conference date for the employee to review the evidence and the reprimand recommendation will be established by the immediate supervisor within two (2) days after receipt of the reprimand notice. The employee will be informed of the purpose of the conference, the nature of the complaint, his/her right to representation, and given an opportunity to defend himself/herself. The two-day (2) prior notice requirement may be waived only by agreement of all parties. Within five (5) days following the conclusion of a conference, the employee will be provided with a final text of the reprimand notice that shall not be dropped or that another action is to be taken. A copy of the reprimand will be placed on file in the Human Resources Office and a copy sent to the employee. The employee will have the opportunity to draft a rebuttal statement for attachment to the reprimand within ten (10) working days of its issue with a copy to higher supervisor.

Employee's representation

iv An employee will always be given the right to include another person of his/her choosing. The employee or the District may tape record the proceedings of a meeting scheduled for the presentation of a letter of reprimand at the request. Whenever other District administrators are to be included in a discipline meeting or conference, notice notice will be provided to the employee and the employee will have the right to add an equal number of representatives.

9.10 C Suspension for just and sufficient cause as allowed by state statute and District policy.
