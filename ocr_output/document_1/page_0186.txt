HOW TO USE YOUR PROGRAM

You may select any licensed dentist. Tell your dentist you are covered by a WDS (or ODS, if applicable) dental program and give your dentist your social security number, the program name, and the number printed on your identification card.

If your dentist is a member dentist, the dentist will submit claim forms to the appropriate Dental Service Plan and receive payment based on the dentist's filed fees. You are responsible for any balance remaining.

If your dentist is not a member dentist, it is your responsibility to have the dentist complete a claim form. You are responsible for paying the dentist's bill and for submitting the claim to the Dental Service Plan. Since the Dental Service Plan does not have filing fees for non-member dentists, payment for services performed by a non-member dentist is made to you based upon actual charges, or the fee charged for the same procedure by 51 percent of member dentists in the area, whichever is less. Payment will be issued in the name of both the employee and the dentist.

If you receive treatment from a dentist outside your normal Dental Service Plan area, it is your responsibility to have the dentist complete a claim form. You are responsible for paying the dentist's bill and for submitting the claim to the Dental Service Plan.

Payment will be based on the dentist's charge, or the amount that would have been payable if treatment had been provided by a member dentist, whichever is less.

You may obtain claim forms from your employer or the Dental Service Plan. The Plan will not be obligated to pay for treatment performed in the event claim forms are submitted for payment more than six (6) months after the date of rendition of such treatment.
