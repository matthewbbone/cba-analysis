Prepaid coverage under service plan contracts or group or individual practice plans;

Labor management trustee plans, labor organization plans, employer organization plans or employee benefit organization plans;

Government programs; and

Coverage required or provided by any statute.

This Plan will use certain rules to coordinate benefits, that is, to decide which plan or program should pay first during a particular period. The period used for calculating benefits under this Plan (called a "claim determination period") is the calendar year.

The rules for coordination of benefits are:

A. If the other plan does not have a "coordination of benefits" provision, that plan is primary and must consider coverage first.

    • For children of divorced parents, the following rules apply:
