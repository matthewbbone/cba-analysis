beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant (or Vested Former Participant), and if more than one such secondary beneficiary shall survive the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) primary beneficiary, payment shall be made in such portions among them as the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) shall have designated; otherwise, each shall receive an equal portion. Such election may be made at any time prior to the date benefit payments commence. The Ten-year (Five-year or Fifteen-year) Certain and Life Thereafter Benefit so payable shall be the actuarial equivalent (computed at the time of retirement) of the benefit otherwise payable thereunder. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. Any election made hereunder may be revoked at any time prior to the date benefit payments commence. The consent of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries will not be required when any revocation of election is made. The "certain period" in the optional benefit shall be reduced, when necessary, so that it does not exceed the life expectancy at the date the benefit commences as listed in Attachment II.

ARTICLE VIII.B. SOCIAL SECURITY LEVELING OPTION

8B.1(a) Subject to Article VIII, a Participant who is eligible for retirement (but not Disability Retirement) may elect to have his benefit paid under the Social Security Leveling Option, provided such benefit commences prior to the earliest age a reduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount could be paid (currently age 62).

(b) Under the Social Security Leveling Option, the Participant will receive the actuarial equivalent of the Accrued Benefit (reduced in accordance with Section 4.2, if applicable) otherwise payable in amounts which, when combined with the estimated reduced Primary Insurance Amount, will, if sufficient, provide a substantially level total benefit. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. Upon reaching the earliest age a reduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount is payable, the monthly income from the retirement plan shall be reduced by the amount of reduced Primary Insurance Amount used in the calculation of the option benefit.

(c) At the Participant's election, the Social Security Leveling Option may be calculated using any later age prior to the first age an unreduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount
