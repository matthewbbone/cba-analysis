Subsection 15.2(a) or (b), as the case may be, on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that Subsection.

15.4 If the assets are not sufficient to cover all benefits in Subsection 15.2(c), they must be allocated under the Plan in effect five years prior to termination. If the assets are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits based on that version of the Plan, then they shall be allocated under the most recent version of the Plan under which the assets are sufficient to satisfy in full the liabilities. Any remaining assets are then allocated as they would have been under the next most recent Plan amendment.

15.5 As provided by law, the Company has obtained Plan termination insurance that will insure Participants (or Vested Former Participants) their spouses, and beneficiaries against loss of certain benefits arising in the event of a complete or partial Plan termination. These benefits are insured and, in the event of Plan termination, may be paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if not paid from the Trust. Such benefits may be reduced as provided in the law.

15.6 If the Plan terminates, the Retirement Committee may, if no discrimination results, direct that amounts payable be calculated on an actuarial basis and be paid either in cash or in other assets, including insurance or annuity contracts, as the Retirement Committee in its discretion may determine.

15.7 The Company shall not receive any amount from the Trust, except such amounts as may remain after satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan.
