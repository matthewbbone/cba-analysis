equivalent of the minimum single-life annuity benefit. If the benefit commences at a date other than at normal retirement age, the employee must receive at least an amount that is the actuarial equivalent of the minimum single-life annuity benefit commencing at normal retirement age.

19.4(a) The nonforfeitable interest of each employee in his employer-derived accrued benefits shall be 100 percent vested after three years of vesting service.

(b) For any Plan year in which this Plan is top heavy, the vesting schedule in (a) will automatically apply to the Plan. The minimum vesting schedule applies to all benefits within the meaning of Section 411(a)(7) of the Code except those attributable to employee contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective date of Section 416 and benefits accrued before the Plan became top heavy. Further, no reduction in vested benefits may occur in the event the Plan's status as top heavy changes for any Plan year. However, this section does not apply to the accrued benefits of any employee who does not have an hour of service after the Plan has initially become top heavy and such employee's accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions will be determined without regard to this section.

(c) If the vesting schedule under the Plan shifts in or out of the schedule in (a) above for any Plan year because of the Plan's top heavy status, such shift is an amendment to the vesting schedule and the right of election of Section 411(a)(10)(B) of the Code shall apply.

(d) The minimum accrued benefit required (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code 416(b)) may not be forfeited under Code 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).

19.5 In any Plan year in which the Plan is top heavy, the figure "1.25" in Article XVIII, as it relates to the maximum benefit dollar limitations under Section 415 of the Code, shall be changed to "1.0."
