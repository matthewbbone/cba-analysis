• The filed fee approved by a Blue Cross/Blue Shield organization for listed services rendered by a participating professional provider;
• The usual and customary or reasonable charge for listed services rendered by non-participating professional providers;
• The reasonable charge for all other listed services and supplies.

The important difference between the benefits for participating providers and non-participating providers is the balance the employee may be required to pay. Once the deductible is satisfied, the balance which the employee may be required to pay to a participating provider will not exceed 20% of the participating provider's charge.

WHAT MEDICALLY NECESSARY MEANS

Medically necessary means those services and supplies that are required for diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury and which are:

• Consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.
• Appropriate with regard to standards of good medical practice;
• Not primarily for the convenience of the patient or a provider of services or supplies; and
• The least costly of the alternative supplies or levels of service which can be safely provided. When specifically applied to a hospital inpatient, it further means that the services or supplies cannot be safely provided in other than a hospital setting without adversely affecting the patient's condition or the quality of medical care rendered.

Medically necessary care does not include care that is primarily custodial care. This is care that helps a person conduct activities of daily living and that can be provided by people without medical or paramedical skills; for example, help in bathing, eating, dressing or getting in or out of bed. Custodial care also includes care that is primarily for the purpose of separating a patient from others or preventing a patient from harming himself/herself.

HOW COVERED CHARGES ARE PAID

The Plan will pay:
A. 100% of the usual and customary or reasonable expenses for:
• Pre-admission testing performed in a doctor's office, clinic or a hospital on an outpatient basis. The individual must be scheduled for admission to a hospital for treatment of the condition which made the tests necessary.
