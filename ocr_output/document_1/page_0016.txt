the Call Time and Overtime provisions, retain his/her assigned day or days off but only for the remainder of that week.

C. The Company will not, solely for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, change the day or days off of employee in a week in which a holiday specified in Section 7 occurs.

D. An employee who has been required to work on his/her assigned day or days off shall not be laid off on one of his/her scheduled work days in the same week solely for the purpose of limiting his/her hours of work to forty (40).

E. In case where an employee is temporarily off work because of a shutdown of his/her job, department, or plant extending for not less than forty-eight (48) hours in excess of that normally encountered in the working schedule, the employee's regular schedule of hours per day and days per week, including his/her starting time, and assigned day(s) off, shall be deemed to have been voided and shall no longer be in effect. It is possible to have an employee's department and/or plant shut down and his/her job continue on a regular schedule; for example, the Environmental Tester/Operator at Cosmopolis could continue to work even though the plant is shut down, or shipping employees at any mill might continue to work on a regular schedule during a shutdown. (In cases like these, the above paragraph provisions would not apply).

B. Notwithstanding paragraph A above, in case any employee is scheduled or ordered to report for work on his/her assigned day or days off and s/he is subsequently notified not to report less than 36 hours prior to the start of such work, s/he shall receive an allowance of two (2) hours' pay at his/her straight-time rate.

C. In case any employee has commenced work on his/her regularly scheduled shift, s/he shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours' pay at his/her straight-time rate.
