PART A - SCHEDULE OF COVERAGES AND BENEFITS BY JOB RATE BRACKETS

A. Group Term Life Insurance

Group Term Life Insurance is provided each employee in accordance with the following Table of Hourly Rate Brackets and Corresponding Coverages. This benefit is payable to an employee's beneficiary in the event of the employee's death from any cause at any time or place while s/he is insured. Payment will be made in a lump sum or in installments to the employee's beneficiary. The employee shall have the right to change his/her beneficiary(s) at any time.

If an employee becomes permanently and totally disabled, so as to be entitled to disability benefits under the Social Security Act, his/her Group Term Life Insurance shall remain in effect as long as s/he remains so disabled and furnished such proofs of continued disability as may be required by the insurance company. The first proof must be filed within three (3) months after such total disability has lasted nine (9) months. Premium payments are waived during the time the insurance is so continued.

An employee who becomes so disabled has the right to elect to receive seventy (70%) percent of his/her Group Term Life Insurance in equal monthly installments (each amounting to one-sixtieth of said insurance plus interest) over a period of sixty (60) consecutive months.

The remaining thirty (30%) percent of the employee's Group Term Life Insurance will remain in force under a waiver of premium as long as the employee remains permanently and totally disabled. The election described above must be made in writing when the disabled employee files the first proof of disability and s/he cannot thereafter change the election so made.

Whenever an application is made to the insurance carrier for approval of extension of his/her insurance because of permanent and total disability, the Company will notify the employee of the above option.

If a permanently and totally disabled employee, who has made the above described election, returns to active work for the Company, his/her Group Term Life Insurance protection will be reduced by the aggregate amount of monthly payments which s/he received prior to returning to work.
