E. Testing

The facility for confirmatory testing must meet all standards set by Federal Health Agencies for laboratory performance, and they must employ certified Medical Technologists and Technicians. The Union will be provided with the testing facilities' names, addresses, and credentials. The Union retains the right to demand a change in test procedure or test facility based on reliable information which disproves the accuracy or quality of either.

2. All samples which test positive will be confirmed. Tests for controlled substances will be confirmed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry test or a superior or equally reliable test if same becomes reasonably available.
