infirmity, ptomaines, bacterial infections, disease, medical or surgical treatment not made necessary by injury covered under the policy, war, or suicide. Benefits will be payable for a loss which is caused by a bacterial infection that develops from a laceration which was the result of an accidental injury covered by this policy.

C. Sickness and Accidental Insurance (Non-Occupational)

Sickness and Accidental weekly disability benefits are provided each employee in accordance with the following Table of Hourly Job Rate Brackets and Corresponding Coverages.

These benefits are payable when an employee is unable to work because of a non-occupational sickness or accident and is under the care of a doctor. Benefit payments start on the first day of disability caused by a non-occupational accident and on the fourth day of disability caused by a non-occupational illness (on the first day when hospitalized). Benefits will be payable for a maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks during any one period of disability, except that maternity benefits for pregnancy, or resulting childbirth or miscarriage are limited to six weeks and are payable only if the pregnancy commenced while the employee's insurance was in force.

Benefits will be payable for as many separate distinct periods of disability as may occur. Periods of disability due to the same cause will be considered the same period of disability unless they are separated by return to full time work for at least two weeks.

Periods of disability due to different causes will be considered different periods of disability if they are separated by return to work. When an employee has been released for work by his/her physician, the term "return to work" shall include the period between his/her release by his/her physician and his/her actual return to work on his/her next scheduled shift.

Benefits payable for fractions of a week will be computed at one-seventh (1/7th) the weekly amount of each day.

No benefits are payable for any period of disability unless the employee is under the care of a physician. No benefits are payable unless the disability commenced while the employee's insurance was in force.
