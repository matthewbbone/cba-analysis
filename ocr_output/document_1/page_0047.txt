6. On the request of either party, the testimony of witnesses shall be given under oath.

7. On application of either party, the arbitrator on his/her own determination may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the production of books, records, documents and other evidence, and the parties hereto agree that such subpoenas are effective to them, their agents, members, and employees. In all other respects if such subpoenas are cognizable under the laws of the State where the arbitration is to be held, they shall be enforceable under such law.

8. The arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time as s/he deems necessary. s/he may order the deposition of a witness to be taken for use as evidence and not for discovery, if the witness cannot be compelled to attend the hearing or if circumstances are such that such depositions are desirable. Such depositions can be ordered by the arbitrator prior to the arbitration hearing where good cause therefore is shown by either party. Reasonable notice to the other party and the right of cross-examination shall be afforded at any deposition.

9. On the conclusion of any hearing, the arbitrator shall rule on the request to submit a written brief if either party makes such a request, or the arbitrator may order that the parties submit briefs.

10. Either party shall have the right to call to the attention of the arbitrator in writing (copy to the other party) any new evidence appearing in the other party's Post Hearing Brief.

11. Neither party may be required to arbitrate more than one grievance as a part of a single case.

F. When the Union requests arbitration, it shall send a copy of its request to the main office of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers. When the Company requests arbitration, it shall send a copy of its request to the Pacific Coast Association of Pulp and Paper Manufacturers. The two associations then shall, by mutual agreement, set the date of the hearing, the place of the hearing, provide notice to the arbitrator, and provide all other "housekeeping" details necessary for the hearing itself.
