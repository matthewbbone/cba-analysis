under the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (2) above.

4) Any employee who is displaced from his/her regular job due to a disabling on-the-job injury, and does maintain a job in the mill, will have his/her rate retained as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) above.

3. Whenever the Company has made plans for substantial technological changes or the closing of departments which will result in permanent reductions of the work force, advance notice and consultation will be held with the Local Union Standing Committee.

Job openings may be, by agreement, earmarked for named employees who are on a list of employees expected to be displaced by changes referred to above. This provision will not apply to normal layoffs.
