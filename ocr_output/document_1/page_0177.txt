NOTE: It is your responsibility to determine if the provider is a participating provider. All claims must be submitted within twelve months of the date of service in order to be processed.

REVIEW OF DENIED CLAIMS

If a claim is denied or partially denied and you feel this decision should be reviewed, write to the Medical Service Plan within 60 days of the date of rejection. (If you want to, you can have someone else do this for you.) Include any information you feel may affect the decision on your claim. You will be allowed to examine any pertinent documents that affected the decision on your claim. The decision on your request for review will be sent to you within 60 days of the date of your request.

If you are still dissatisfied, you may request that a second review be done by Washington Physicians Service. Again, the request must be in writing, and you should submit it within 60 days of the date of the first review. Send the request to: 600 Fourth and Battery Building, Seattle, WA 98121. You will receive a response within 60 days after your request.

RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS

Any person who applies for or accepts benefits under the coverage described in this booklet automatically authorizes Washington Physicians Service or the Medical Service Plans to examine any medical records necessary to process claims. Any such person also authorizes any provider of care, government agency or insurance carrier to release his/her medical records to WPS or the Medical Service Plans. Any information obtained will be kept confidential.

SERVICE AREA

All counties in Washington (except Yakima County) and Lane and Coos Counties in Oregon are included. Because there is no Medical Service Plan in Yakima County writing prepaid health contracts, Washington Physicians Service cannot guarantee that the physicians in Yakima County will accept its benefits as payment in full for their services. All other benefits of the Plan are available in Yakima County. (Claims for services in this area are processed by King County Medical Blue Shield.)

The employee's and dependent's health care coverage will be canceled as of the end of the day an employee is terminated from the payroll of the Company.

When the employee-employer relationship has not been terminated, but the employee is not actively at work, health care coverage will be subject to the following conditions:
