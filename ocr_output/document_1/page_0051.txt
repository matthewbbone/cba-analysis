III. Contract Work

A. It is the intent of the Company to fully utilize maintenance employees at all covered mills. Maintenance work traditionally and normally performed by Company employees will be performed by these employees unless:

1. Appropriate skills are unavailable, or

3. Manhours necessary to complete the job are unavailable within the time period during which the Company feels the job must be completed, or unless use of Company's personnel would curtail or delay necessary maintenance work.

Total maintenance cost effectiveness can only be achieved through full and efficient use of our maintenance workforce and cost effective use of contractors.
