health care program sponsored by another company, or is eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs first.

If coverage terminates because the spouse remarries, the spouse will be eligible to continue coverage by self-paying the full monthly cost if:
a. he or she is not covered by another group health care plan, and
b. less than 36 months have elapsed since the employee's death.
In this event the spouse can self-pay for continued coverage only through the 36th month following the day the employee died.

2. If the employee was not eligible for early retirement and the death was as a result of non-industrial cause, coverage for eligible dependents will continue for six months following the month in which the death occurs. Coverage can then be continued for up to an additional 30 months by self-paying the full monthly cost.

Eligibility for continued coverage on a self-payment basis will end on the earliest of:
a. the 30-month period indicated above, or
b. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or
c. the date a person becomes covered under another group health care plan, or
d. in the case of a spouse, the date such spouse remarries and becomes covered under another group health care plan, or
e. the date the plan terminates.

1. Divorce

If a spouse loses coverage due to a divorce or legal separation, he or she may continue coverage by paying the full monthly cost until the earliest of:
1. 36 months from the day which the divorce or legal separation occurred, or
2. the date the spouse becomes eligible for Medicare, or
3. the date the spouse becomes covered under another group health care plan, or
4. the date the spouse remarries and becomes covered under another group health care plan, or
5. the date the plan terminates.
