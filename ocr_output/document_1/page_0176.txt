HOW TO FILE A CLAIM

Participating Providers _ You will receive an identification card which includes the employee's name and social security number, the group name and group number, and the Medical Service Plan number. The card should be presented to the participating provider when treatment is received. Participating providers will normally bill the Medical Service Plan directly and will receive payment directly from the Medical Service Plan. There will be no claim form to fill out.

Non-Participating Providers _ You must file a claim for services by a non-participating provider. The claim must include the following: an itemized statement from the provider, the employee's name and social security number, the patient's name if the claim is for a dependent, and the group name and group number.

If the provider's statement indicates that the bill has been paid in full, the reimbursement check will be made out to the employee. If no proof-of-payment is furnished, the reimbursement check will name the employee and provider as co-payees.

Special claim forms are available for prescription drug claims.
