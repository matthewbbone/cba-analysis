B. GUIDELINES

1. The written seniority ground rules at the mill as of the date of this Agreement shall continue in effect during the period of this Agreement.

In all cases of layoff extending longer than the beginning of the Monday next following the day the layoff starts or the first scheduled shift following expiration of seventy-two (72) hours from the time the layoff begins, whichever is longer, a qualified senior regular employee will not be continued on layoff as long as a junior employee is working on a layoff pool job, subject to the conditions set forth in seniority ground rules. When practical, qualified senior regular employees will be allowed to bump earlier than the time limits established in this paragraph. Senior regular employees who are not qualified for any layoff pool job held by a junior employee shall, at the end of the time period provided in the first sentence of this paragraph, be given a reasonable training period in order to qualify for a layoff pool job.
