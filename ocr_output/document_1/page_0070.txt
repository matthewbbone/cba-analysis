mechanic's promotion from one classification to another. It is also understood and agreed that a person who fails to pass the test after the period of either one (1) year to 1800 worked hours, whichever is longer, in either the Junior or Junior "A" or Intermediate or Intermediate "A" classification will be given an additional period of time, not in excess of one (1) year, during which a second test will be given, and if s/he fails to pass the second test s/he shall be removed from the crew.

10. The Union and the Company commit to the upgrading and utilization of the apprenticeship programs at each mill. Our purpose in so doing is to establish education, training and promotion through the Mechanics Program as a superior quality alternative to hiring mechanics from outside the mill.

The commitment includes but is not limited to:
• Quarterly planning discussions with the joint mechanics committee to review manning/progression.
• An active Joint Mechanics Committee
• Defined and documented education/training programs for apprentices.
• On-the-job training to develop the skills required.
• Updated and improved selection processes.

Outside mechanics may be employed in any of the established classifications, subject to the following:

a. An outside mechanic is any person outside the mill or any employee outside the trades with less than two (2) years seniority.*

b. Whenever an outside mechanic is employed, the most senior employee in the crew in the next lowest, occupied, Mechanic's job rate classification in that trade, will be given the opportunity to take the applicable test for advancement. Upon satisfactory passing of that test, s/he will be immediately advanced to his/her next higher mechanic's classification. If s/he fails this test, s/he must wait his/her regular period before taking the test again.

Whenever the most senior employee in the crew in the next lowest classification in that trade is a Mechanic's Helper, s/he shall immediately be advanced to Junior Mechanic
