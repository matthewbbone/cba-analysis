a. Provided that such rules shall be posted in each department where they may be read by all employees and further, that no changes in present rules or no additional rules shall be made that are inconsistent with this Agreement; and further provided, that any existing or new rules or changes in rules may be the subject of discussion between the Local Union Standing Committee and the Local Mill Manager, and in case of disagreement, the procedure for other grievances shall apply.

B. Discharge, Suspension and Written Reprimand

1. Discharge, suspension or letter of reprimand of an employee shall be for just and sufficient cause. A full written explanation shall be given to the employee. A copy of such explanation shall be given to a member of the Local Union Standing Committee within thirty-six (36) hours of the action being taken, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded.

2. No employee will be requested or required to sign a letter of reprimand.

3. Where a letter of reprimand, suspension or discharge is deemed justified, the final decision will be deferred until the appropriate Local Union representative has a reasonable opportunity to investigate the facts and then discuss the matter with the appropriate supervisor in the presence of the employee. This shall not apply when the employee must be removed immediately from the mill because of possible danger to the employee, other persons or Company property.

a. Whenever the Company removes an employee from the mill because of possible danger to the employee, other persons, or Company property, they will notify the Local Union as soon as possible and, if requested, the Company will meet with the Local Union representative within twenty-four (24) hours.

4. A supervisor will not under any conditions dissuade an employee from getting Union assistance by openly or otherwise threatening the employee with loss of standing or any other form of reprisal if the employee should bring the Local Union representative into the issue.
