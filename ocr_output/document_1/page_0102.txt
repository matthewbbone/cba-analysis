Unmarried dependent children who are developmentally or physically disabled past their 26th birthday if all of the following conditions are met:

2. The individual is chiefly dependent on the employee for support and maintenance.

3. Proof of the individual's disability is submitted to the insurance carriers within 31 days after the date his/her coverage would otherwise have ended.
