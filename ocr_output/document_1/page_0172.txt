WHAT IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS FROM OTHER SOURCES?

Situations may arise in which health care expenses are the responsibility of a source other than this Plan. Here are descriptions of the situations that may arise and how the Plan will deal with them.

Third Party Liability

There may be situations in which a person (an employee or an eligible dependent) may have a legal right to recover the costs of his/her health care from a third party who may be responsible for the illness or injury. For example, if a person was injured in a store, the owner may be responsible for the health care expenses arising out of the injury. As another example, if a person becomes sick or is injured as a result of, or in the course of, employment or self-employment, the employer or a workers' compensation insurer may be responsible for health care expenses from the illness or injury.

If this Plan paid any benefits, it will be entitled to recover the amount paid from the proceeds of any settlement or recovery received from the third party.

Motor Vehicle Coverage

This Plan will not pay benefits for health care costs to the extent that they are covered by motor vehicle insurance. But the Plan will pay expenses over the amount covered by the motor vehicle insurance.

Coordination of Benefits

A person may have other health plans or programs that duplicate benefits provided by this plan. When a person is covered under more than one plan, medical expenses are first considered by the "primary plan". Any remaining covered charges may then be considered by the "secondary plan".

If this plan is determined to be secondary, claims should be sent to the "primary plan" first. This plan's payment will then be limited to what this plan would have paid if it were primary less whatever is paid by the other (primary) plan. (For individuals at the Cosmopolis operation, this plan's payment will be limited to the amount not paid by the primary plan but in no case more than the usual and customary or reasonable charge for a covered expense from all sources except an individual or family (non-group) health insurance policy.

For purposes of this provision, the following sources of benefits are all considered health plans or programs:

- Group blanket or franchise health insurance policies issued by insurers or health care service contractors;
