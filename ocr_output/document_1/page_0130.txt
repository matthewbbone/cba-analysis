(B) the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation.

(ii) If the annual benefit described in 18.1(a) begins prior to the Participant's Social Security Retirement Age as specified by under Section 216(1) of the Social Security Act (except that such section shall be applied without regard to the age increase factor and as if the early retirement age under Section 216(1)(2) of such act was age 62), then the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be reduced in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall describe.

The reduction procedure as currently described in Internal Revenue Service Notice 87-21 is as follows:

(A) For a benefit which starts after age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation is reduced by \(5/9\) of \(1\%\) for each of the first 36 months and \(5/12\) of \(1\%\) for each additional month (but not before age 62) by which the benefit commences before the Social Security retirement age.

(B) For a benefit which starts before age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the reduced Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation at age 62 as determined in (A) above.

(iii) For a benefit which starts after the Social Security retirement age, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation in effect at the Participant's Social Security retirement age.

(iv) For purposes of this Section 18.1(b), the actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II.

(c) The Maximum Benefit described in 18.1(b) shall be subject to the following:

(i) The maximum amount shall apply to a single life annuity benefit.

(ii) If the Participant has fewer than ten years of plan participation at retirement, the applicable maximum shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is his plan participation and the denominator of which is ten, provided that said fraction shall in no event be less than \(1/10\)th.
