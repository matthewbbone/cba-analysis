THEORETICAL PORTFOLIO FOR MONTH
Determined for each Experience Month, it consists of bonds in such face amounts (par value) and such monthly maturities so that $100, plus the maturing face amounts, plus interest on the unmatured face amounts would be sufficient to provide the Theoretical Annuity.

Face amounts which do not mature on an Integral Annual Maturity Period will be deemed to earn the Annual Maturity Period Interest Rate for the next succeeding Integral Annual Maturity Period.

MONTHLY PRESENT VALUE
For any month, the sum of the face amounts of bonds in the Theoretical Portfolio for Month plus $100 additional.

WEIGHTED INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
The interest rate for which the present value of the Theoretical Annuity equals the Monthly Present Value, calculated to five decimal places.

VALUATION INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
The Weighted Interest Rate for Month Rounded to the nearest multiple of .1 percent.

The Valuation Interest Rate for Month shall apply to retirements in the second succeeding calendar month. For example, the Valuation Interest Rate for January shall be used for retirements between March 1 and March 31 inclusive.

The Valuation Interest Rate to be used for retirements in a particular month shall not be greater than 120% of the PBGC Immediate Annuity Interest Rate for Month as in effect on the Date of Distribution. For this purpose, the Date of Distribution shall be defined as the day before the Check Date of the payment. The Check Date shall always be the first of a month.

PBGC IMMEDIATE ANNUITY INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
That rate defined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as being the interest rate which the Corporation will use in a particular month to determine the present value of Immediate Annuities.

CALCULATION PROCEDURE
Step 1:
The PBGC Immediate Annuity Interest Rate for Month shall be used, along with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices to determine a lump-sum actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefit
