However, any employee adversely affected by such an action by the Company has the right to pursue a grievance pursuant to all of the provisions in paragraph 7, but if it reaches the arbitration stage, the arbitrator's decision shall not establish, change or eliminate any progression ladder.

6. The parties agree that a job opening on any rung of a ladder above the bottom rung shall be filled by the most senior qualified employee then on the rung next below the rung that is to be filled. Exceptions to the foregoing may be established by mutual agreement but failing such agreement the procedures for filling an opening caused by an absence during the week for which the schedule has previously been posted or by vacations shall conform with the practice in the mill as of October 1, 1964.

Any dispute, arising out of the claim that an employee's job rights based on his/her seniority have been adversely affected by the Company's application of governing seniority ground rule(s) (or in the absence thereof, this Section 20), may be processed through the entire grievance procedure. Should the dispute reach the arbitration stage, the arbitrator's decision shall be limited to (1) directing the placement of an employee on a job giving effect to his/her seniority and qualifications and (2) if back pay is an issue, and the arbitrator orders payment thereof, it shall not be retroactive to a date earlier than the date the grievance was first presented as a formal grievance in accordance with Section 28.
