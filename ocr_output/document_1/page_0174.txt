which parent has custody, that parent's plan is primary.

• If none of the previous rules under B applies, then the contract that has covered the person for the longer period *is* the primary policy and must pay first.

The Plan can release or obtain any information necessary to determine the coordination of benefits. And the employee or any insured dependent must supply the Plan with any information or releases needed for this purpose.

Correction of Payments. If another plan makes payments this Plan should have made under this coordination provision, this Plan can reimburse the other plan directly. Any such reimbursement payments will count as benefits paid under this Plan, and will be released from liability to the employee regarding them.

If this Plan makes payments that should have been made by another plan, it will have the right to recover them from the person for or for whom they were made, or from insurance companies or other organizations. The person involved must sign any documents that are necessary to enforce the Plan's rights under this provision.

WHAT IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE?

As a general rule, this Plan is secondary to Medicare and will not pay benefits toward any part of a covered expense to the extent the covered expense is actually paid or would have been paid under Medicare Part A or B had the eligible insured employee or insured dependent properly enrolled and applied for benefits.

There are two exceptions to this general rule. In the following two situations, this Plan will be primary and will not reduce benefits because of Medicare:

• For covered employees age 65 through 69 who are actively at work and insured spouses age 65 through 69 when the insured employee elects in writing to make this Plan primary over Medicare.
• For covered employees or insured dependents who incur covered expenses for kidney transplant or kidney dialysis when by law Medicare is secondary to employee group health plans.
