2. Spouse Group Life Insurance

Under this plan you may purchase one-half of your Basic Life amount. During the initial enrollment period, you can enroll your spouse in coverage without providing proof of good health. You can request coverage for your spouse after the initial enrollment period, but s/he would then need to prove good health by submitting a statement of health (a medical examination may also be required). If you get married after the initial enrollment period, you can enroll your spouse without having to prove good health, provided your spouse enrolls within 30 days of the marriage.

Monthly cost is based on your age.

3. Child Group Life

Coverage amounts are fixed, based on the child's age at the time of death:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Child's Age</th>
    <th>Amount of Coverage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Birth to 13 days</td>
    <td>No coverage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>14 days up to 6 months</td>
    <td>$500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 months up to 2 years</td>
    <td>$2,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 years to 19 (25 years)</td>
    <td>$5,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The cost is a flat $.50 per month, regardless of the number of children covered or the amount of coverage.

If you do not sign up for Child Group Life within 31 days of the plan effective date, the day you become eligible, or a child's birth date, you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period (November of each year) to enroll. Coverage will then be effective on the following January 1.
