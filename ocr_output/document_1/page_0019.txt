starting time when the employee changes back to his/her previously established starting time at the end of the temporary period.

c. When the change in starting time is within one (1) hour of the previously established starting time and the employee is already on the plantsite, no Call Time is payable.

5. Certain privileges such as working on an employee's assigned day(s) off, trading shifts, or reporting for work at an earlier or later starting time than that established, are often requested by employees for their own convenience. The Company grants those privileges when approved by the employee's supervisor. The Call Time provisions are not intended to prevent or affect that practice and as those practices are for the employee's convenience, Call Time is not payable in such cases.

6. When an employee is temporarily off work because of a shutdown of his/her job department, or plant, extending for not less than forty-eight (48) hours in excess of that normally encountered in his/her working schedule, the employee's regular schedule of hours per day and days per week, including his/her starting time and assigned day(s) off shall be deemed to have been voided and shall no longer be in effect. Call Time shall not be payable for any assignments to extra work during the shutdown period or for assignments in connection with the resumption of operation of the job. It is possible to have an employee's department and/or plant shutdown and his/her job continue on a regular schedule; for example, the Environmental Tester/Operator at Cosmopolis could continue to work even though the plant is shutdown, or shipping employees at any mill might continue to work on a regular schedule during a shut down. (In cases like these, the above paragraph provisions would not apply).

7. It is agreed that the starting time of an employee's work may be changed at any time by the Company.

8. It is further understood and agreed that in the payment of Call Time on the basis provided in this Section not more than one basis shall be used to cover the same period of work, nor will Call Time be added to or paid in lieu of allowances payable under Section 12 or Section 14.
