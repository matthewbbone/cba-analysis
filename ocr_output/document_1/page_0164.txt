will be postponed until the patient is discharged from the hospital. If the patient's hospital stay is extended by a new condition, which is unrelated to the condition causing the original hospitalization, benefits will be paid for the new condition.

WHEN COVERAGE BEGINS

Coverage for all current employees and their eligible dependents will begin on the effective date of the Plan.

COST OF COVERAGE

In the event that the composite premium cost (including HMOs) exceeds $350 per month per employee, employees shall share 50% of any such excess cost, up to a maximum of $17.50/month. (Effective 1/1/99, the employee premium sharing cap will increase to $35.00/month.) For employees opting for alternate coverage plans, the "monthly premium cost of the health care plan provided by the Company" shall be the Company-paid portion of the composite premium. The employee contribution shall be withheld on a pre-tax basis.

HOW BENEFITS ARE PAID

The Plan will pay 100% of the eligible covered charges for:

• Pre-admission testing
• Voluntary secondary surgical opinions
• Home health care
• Outpatient surgery (including both provider and facility expenses)

For all other covered charges, the calendar year deductible explained below must be satisfied; then the Plan will pay 80%.

If, during any calendar year, the employee incurs covered out-of-pocket expenses, including the deductible, in the amount shown in the following schedule, then, for the remainder of that calendar year all covered charges incurred by the employee will be paid at 100%. If, during any calendar year, the employee's eligible dependents, as a group, incur covered out-of-pocket expenses, including the deductible, in the amount shown in the following schedule, then, for the remainder of that calendar year all covered charges incurred by eligible dependents will be paid at 100%.
