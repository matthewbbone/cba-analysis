ESTIMATE OF BENEFITS

If your dental care will be extensive, ask your dentist to complete and submit a standard WDS or ODS claim form for an estimate. This will allow you to know, in advance exactly what procedures are covered, the amount that will be paid toward the treatment and your financial responsibility.

EXPLANATION OF INCENTIVE PERIODS

Your program is an incentive program designed to provide regular dental care. An incentive period consists of 12 consecutive calendar months. The first incentive period starts with the first day of the month that an eligible person uses dental services and ends on the subsequent June 30th. Thereafter, each incentive period shall consist of the period between July 1 and the subsequent June 30th.

PAYMENT LEVELS FOR CLASS I AND CLASS II BENEFITS

During the first incentive period, the payment level for covered and allowable Class I and Class II benefits is 70%. This payment level advances 10 percentage points each successive incentive period in which benefits of this program are used by an eligible person. The payment level increases to a maximum level of 100%. You must visit the dentist at least once during each annual incentive period in order to increase, or maintain, your payment level. If an eligible person fails to utilize benefits in an incentive period, the payment level will be decreased by 10 percentage points for each incentive period for which benefits were not used. This deduction will be made from the last payment level used by the Plan in making payment for the eligible person. In no event will the payment level be less than the starting 70% level.

Each eligible person establishes his or her own payment levels though utilization during incentive periods.

PAYMENT LEVEL FOR CLASS III BENEFITS

The payment level for covered and allowable Class III benefits is 70%. The incentive provision described above does not apply to Class III Benefits. The payment level for covered dental expenses arising as a direct result of an accidental bodily injury is 100%, up to the unused program maximum.

PROGRAM MAXIMUM

The maximum amount payable for Class I, Class II and Class III Covered Dental Benefits per eligible person is $1,500 each 12-month period July 1 through June 30. Charges for dental procedures requiring multiple treatment dates shall be considered incurred, and shall be applied to the program maximum, on the date the service is completed.
