2.3 Subject to Section 11.2(a), benefit payments shall not commence until actual retirement. A Participant's actual retirement shall be deemed to occur with respect to any month following his Normal Retirement Date if, in such month, the Participant is credited with less than 40 hours of service. Once payments of benefits to a retired Participant have commenced, such payments shall not be affected by the Participant's reemployment. A Participant whose benefit payments are limited by this section (i.e., suspended because his service continues subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date) (i) shall be so notified in writing, either by personal delivery or first class mail, and (ii) must notify the Retirement Committee in writing at such time as his hours of service are less than 40 per month. In the event that benefits which should have been suspended are paid to a Retiree in error, future payments shall be reduced until the Trust has recovered the overpayment. The initial monthly amount of such reduction may be offset by 100% of the monthly payment and future payments may be reduced by not more than 25% of any one future monthly payment. Participants who are uncertain whether specific employment will result in a suspension of benefits hereunder should contact the Retirement Committee for a determination. Any suspension of benefits permitted by this section shall not apply to that portion of a benefit provided by employee contributions (if any).
