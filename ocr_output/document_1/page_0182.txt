EXTENDED COVERAGE

If you or one of your insured dependents is hospitalized as an in-patient in a designated hospital at the time your coverage under this Plan terminates, benefits will continue as long as you are hospitalized or until the benefits are exhausted, whichever occurs first. These benefits are available only for the original condition for which you were hospitalized.

If you or one of your insured dependents is (1) totally disabled and (2) under active treatment by a physician on the date your eligibility for this Plan ends, benefits will continue to be furnished (but only in connection with treatment for the condition causing the total disability) as follows:

Employee - Benefits will be provided up to six months or until the maximum benefits have been paid, whichever occurs first.

Dependents - Benefits will be provided up to three months or until the maximum benefits have been paid, whichever occurs first.

Total disability shall mean any medically determined condition which prevents the employee or dependent from engaging in any occupation because of physical or mental impairment. Satisfactory proof of such disability and its continuation shall be furnished by the patient.

CONVERSION OF COVERAGE

Should you or your dependents lose eligibility for coverage under this Plan, you will be issued an individual Hospital-Surgical-Medical contract by your local Medical Service Plan, provided (1) you make application for individual coverage within 31 days after ceasing to be eligible and qualified under this Plan, (2) you reside in Washington or Lane or Coos Counties, Oregon, and (3) you abide by other rules and regulations established by your local Medical Service Plan.

In the event an applicant for an individual contract moves his/her residence outside Washington or Lane or Coos Counties, Oregon, the local Medical Service Plan, upon request, will assist in all reasonable ways in transferring coverage to another physician-sponsored plan, with full credit
