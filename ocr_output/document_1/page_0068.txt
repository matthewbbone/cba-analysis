upon presenting evidence of qualification, be reimbursed for tuition, required books and any fee required for taking the test for qualification. The institution offering any such schooling and the courses of study must be approved by the Company before enrollment.

6. An applicant selected by the Company to learn a mechanical trade will be placed, when a vacancy exists, on a Mechanic's Helper's job for a period of one year elapsed time or 1800 worked hours, whichever is longer; and at the end of the period, if s/he is retained, s/he will be automatically promoted to Junior Mechanic.

7. During the first ninety (90) days after an applicant has been regularly assigned to a Mechanic's Helper's job, s/he will be classed as probationary on that crew, and s/he can be removed from the crew at any time during that period. Prior to removal from the crew of any such probationary helper because of his/her performance, the Company will notify the Local Union Standing Committee(s) of the intended action and justification thereof. If the Local Union Standing Committee(s) considers the proposed removal unjustified, it may take the matter up with the Mill Manager, whose decision in the matter shall not be subject to the arbitration procedure. If such applicant is transferred to the mechanical crew from another department in the plant, s/he will retain his/her seniority in the department from which s/he transferred for a period of ninety (90) days, and will be returned to the job from which s/he transferred if removed from the crew. If s/he is removed from the crew after a period of ninety (90) days, s/he will retain his/her plant seniority and be given a job, preferably in the department from which s/he transferred at the starting rate in that department, but if that is not available, s/he will be given a base rate job in the plant; however, such rights shall not apply if discharged for cause. During the probationary period, the Company will determine as quickly as practical whether or not the applicant has the aptitude and other characteristics necessary to become a journeyman. Unless a Helper has earlier been removed from the crew, prior to the expiration of the first ninety (90) days after s/he has been regularly assigned as a Helper, the Company will review with the employee his/her progress to date.
