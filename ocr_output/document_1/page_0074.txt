D. In order to clarify the application of the payment of night shift differential, a number of examples are set forth as follows:

1. A shift worker on a graveyard shift who, because of absence of his/her mate or for some other reason, is required to remain over and work on one of the jobs on the following day shift shall not be considered as continuing his/her night shift but will be considered as working a new shift which is an established day shift. Accordingly, s/he would not receive the night shift differential for his/her work on the established day shift.

2. For the same reason as in example 1, a shift worker on a day shift who, because of the absence of his/her mate or for some other reason, is held over to work on one of the jobs on the second shift, which would be a night shift, would also be considered as working on a new shift and would receive the night shift differential for his/her work on the second shift.

3. In the case of the mechanic or other day worker whose shift is changed to one which qualifies as a night shift, s/he would receive the night shift differential regardless of the amount of advance notice s/he received as to his/her change of shifts.

4. In the case of a mechanic or other day worker who works his/her regular day shift and then is held over to work overtime, s/he would be deemed to be continuing to work the same shift s/he has started at 8:00 a.m. (or whatever his/her starting time was), and would not be considered as working on a new shift. Accordingly, s/he would not receive any night shift differential unless the total hours worked after 6:00 p.m. were enough to offset the number of hours worked before 6:00 p.m. In other words, the total hours worked, including both his/her regular hours and overtime hours, would be considered as one continuous shift and only where one half or more of those total hours fall after 6:00 p.m. and before 6:00 a.m. would that shift be considered a night shift. A continuous shift as mentioned above may include a reasonable meal period and the work following a reasonable meal should not be construed as a new shift of work.

5. In the case of a mechanic or other day worker who is called in or instructed to come in ahead of his/her regular day shift and worked into his/her regular day shift, s/he would also be considered as working one continuous shift as outlined in
