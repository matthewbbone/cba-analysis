Note: Each of the hourly job rates in the above table is defined as the straight-time day rate of the employee's regular job exclusive of all premium and fringes. The Part-Time Employee Brackets, without regard to the hourly job rate, will apply to any employee who is regularly scheduled to work thirty or more hours per week.

* A Part-Time Extra Board employee will be insured for Group Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment in accordance with the employee's hourly rate and the foregoing table. Weekly Sickness and Accident benefits, as shown in the foregoing table, will be prorated on the basis of all hours worked in the preceding calendar quarter in relation to 520 straight-time hours; however, in no event will such benefits be less than $40 per week or more than the amounts shown in the table.

D. VOLUNTARY GROUP LIFE INSURANCE

There are three employee-paid coverages available: voluntary group life, spouse group life, and child group life. These plans are elective and the participant pays 100% of the premium through payroll deduction. These benefits are available to all eligible hourly employees on the plan effective date. New employees are eligible on the first day of employment. If you are not actively at work on the day you would normally become eligible, you will be eligible on the day you return to active work.
