WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY 401(k) PLAN FOR HOURLY RATED EMPLOYEES NORTHWEST PULP AND PAPERBOARD OPERATIONS

Saving for the future is something we all should do. To help in this task, Weyerhaeuser and your bargaining representatives started a savings plan on October 1, 1988, to benefit you as an hourly Weyerhaeuser employee. This savings plan provides you with a convenient tax-sheltered way to save for your long-term goals. The name of the plan is the Weyerhaeuser company Hourly 401(k) Plan, AWPPW.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), through the use of tax-deferred savings plans known as 401(k) plans, permits the deferral of income taxes on dollars saved. Your plan is a 401(k) plan. It is a voluntary program that offers you an easy, convenient way to prepare for your future financial needs.

Highlights
• You can defer from 1 to 14 percent of your pay through convenient payroll deductions.
• Your money is invested as you choose in any of five investment objectives.
• Your current taxes are reduced because you contribute to the plan on a before-tax basis, and your investment earnings accumulate tax-deferred.

The Company adds to your deferral with a matching contribution. The Company contribution is in the form of Weyerhaeuser Company Stock.

You are eligible to join the plan after one year of service. Your participation is voluntary. You may join the plan any month following the date you become eligible. To join the plan, complete a 401(k) Application for Participation form (#10266) and submit it to the Investment Growth Department, TF 6F, Tacoma WA 98477.
