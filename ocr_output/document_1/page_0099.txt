I. Voluntary Group Life Insurance

Under this plan, you can purchase up to eight times your Basic Life Insurance Amount in whole increments (one, two, three, up to eight times Basic Life).

During the initial enrollment period, you can elect up to five times the amount of your Basic Life insurance without providing proof of good health. Greater amounts of coverage can be elected by submitting a statement of health (a medical examination may also be required).

Annually, thereafter, there will be an open enrollment period in November to initially enroll in or increase your amount of coverage. Coverage can be increased by one time during this period without proof of good health. Greater amounts of coverage can be elected by submitting a statement of health (a medical examination may also be required). Coverage will not become effective until January of the following year.

Your monthly cost will be based on your age and the amount of insurance you choose. When your age or amount of coverage changes, any increase in your cost will be effective on the first day of the following pay period.
