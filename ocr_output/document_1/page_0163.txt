Eligibility of Dependents
Eligible dependents are:
A. The employee's lawful spouse.
B. Any unmarried dependent child who is:
   • Less than 26 years of age, permanently residing in the employee's household, and claimed as an exemption on the employee's federal income tax return; or
   • Less than 26 years of age and legally entitled to medical coverage under a court decree; or
   • Developmentally or physically disabled, incapable of self-sustaining employment, and chiefly dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance. Such child will be eligible for coverage past age 26 if:
      • The dependent was disabled prior to reaching the limiting age; and
      • Proof of such developmental or physical disability and dependence is provided to the Medical Service Plan within 31 days after the dependent reaches the limiting age, and subsequently thereafter as required by the Medical Service Plan, subject to state laws.

NOTE: No person will be eligible for dependent coverage while covered as an employee under this Plan.

Dependent's Effective Date
Coverage for eligible dependents will begin on the date the employee's coverage becomes effective.
If a dependent is acquired after the employee's coverage has become effective, the new dependent should be enrolled within 31 days after acquisition (provided the employee's coverage is in effect at that time).

A newborn child is eligible for coverage at birth and should be enrolled within 31 days from date of birth.
It is essential that you promptly enroll newly-acquired dependents. Failure to do so may delay the processing of any claims. To enroll new dependents, contact your personnel office.
In an employee's dependent (other than a newborn child) is confined in a hospital on the date coverage would otherwise become effective, coverage
