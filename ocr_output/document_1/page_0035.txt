been discharged for cause, and provided the employee gives fourteen (14) calendar days' notice of his/her intent, s/he shall receive pro-rata vacation pay equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty (50) hours for each week of vacation to which s/he was entitled on the previous June 1st for each completed month of service from said June 1st to the date of his/her termination.

K. The allotment of vacation time is to be decided by the Company. Notwithstanding paragraph E of Section 10, the Company is permitted, but not obligated, to adjust starting days of vacation time for employees, if so requested. No employee is to have the privilege of drawing vacation pay and continuing to work in lieu of taking the vacation until that employee has scheduled two weeks off. Exercise of this privilege shall be voluntary on the part of the employee. No employee will be required to take vacation during a shutdown of that employee's job, department, or mill.

L. 1. Employees will not be laid off or terminated for the purpose of avoiding vacation payments.
2. One week's vacation shall be continuous. Whenever operating conditions permit, two weeks' continuous vacation shall be so scheduled. Within the limits of this statement of principle, allotment of vacation time is to be decided by the Company. In administering the allotment of vacation time, the Company shall give timely notice to each employee of his/her proposed allotment and shall then consider in good faith, before making final decision, any change asked for by the employee or the Local Union Standing Committee. Such change may be asked for and shall be considered whether it arises from a personal preference for a vacation during a particular part of the contract year or from an announcement by the Company that the vacation time is to be allotted so as to coincide with an announced shutdown.
3. The parties agree that one (1) week of vacation on a day-at-a-time basis may be authorized by local mutual agreement, provided the effect of such agreement would not be to significantly increase mill costs. Guidelines developed locally shall not modify or supersede any benefit provided by this Master Labor Agreement. Upon request of either party, the local committees shall meet and discuss this issue in good faith.
