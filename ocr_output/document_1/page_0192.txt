I. Strike, Lockout or Other Labor Dispute

An employee may make payment of premiums directly to Weyerhaeuser Company for a period not exceeding six months, in the event of suspension of compensation because of a lockout, strike or other labor dispute. It is the responsibility of the employer to immediately notify the employees of their right to make payments when their compensation is so suspended or terminated.

J. Termination

If an employee loses coverage because his or her employment terminates (other than gross misconduct) or because work hours are reduced, the employee can continue coverage for self and eligible dependents by paying the full monthly cost. Coverage can be continued until the earliest of:

1. 18 months from the day coverage ceased, or
2. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or
3. the date a person becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or
4. the date the plan terminates.

SELF-PAYMENT NOTIFICATION PROCESS

If an employee or eligible dependents loses coverage as a result of death, termination of employment or reduction in hours worked and is eligible to self-pay for continued coverage as explained in the section titled "Cessation of Active Work," Weyerhaeuser Group Insurance Services will notify the employee or dependents of their self-pay options and the plan's monthly costs. The eligible person will then have up to 60 days to decide whether or not to purchase the coverage.

If a spouse loses coverage due to divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child loses coverage because he or she has reached the maximum coverage age and wants to continue coverage, the employee, spouse or child must notify the local Personnel Department or the Weyerhaeuser Group Insurance Services Manager at the following address within 60 days of the event causing loss of coverage:

Group Insurance Services Manager
Weyerhaeuser Company
Tacoma WA 98477

The spouse or child will then be contacted about the self-pay option and the plan's monthly costs and will have 60 days to decide about purchasing the coverage.
