rules are available upon request from the American Arbitration Association or the Dental Service Plan. If appealed to arbitration, the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the appealing party and upon all other parties whose interests are affected.

SUBROGATION

To the extent of any amounts paid by the Dental Service Plan for an eligible person on account of services made necessary by an injury to or condition of his or her person, it shall be subrogated to his or her rights against any third party liable for the injury or condition. The Plan shall, however, not be obligated to pay for such services unless and until the eligible person, or someone legally qualified and authorized to act for him or her, promises in writing to:

- Include those amounts in any claim he or she makes against a third party for the injury or condition;
- Repay the Dental Service Plan those amounts to the extent that the proceeds of the eligible person's recovery from a settlement with a third party by reason of such injury or condition exceed his or her own portion of the total loss;
- Prorate any attorneys' fees incurred in the recovery; and
- Cooperate fully with the Dental Service Plan in asserting its rights under this program, to supply the Plan with any and all information and execute any and all instruments the Plan reasonably needs for that purpose.

What this means is that if you receive this program's benefits for an accidental injury and a liability claim is brought against another person who may have been responsible for the accident, benefits payable by the Dental Service Plan must be included in the claim, and when the claim is settled, the Plan must be reimbursed for the benefits provided.
