straight-line interpolation between the Annual Maturity yields which immediately bracket the omitted periods.'

THEORETICAL ANNUITY
An annuity-certain of $100 per month for 20 years, payable monthly in advance.

THEORETICAL PORTFOLIO FOR MONTH
Determined for each Experience Month, it consists of bonds in such face amounts (par value) and such monthly maturities so that $100, plus the maturing face amounts, plus interest on the unmatured face amounts would be sufficient to provide the Theoretical Annuity.

Face amounts which do not mature on an Integral Annual Maturity Period will be deemed to earn the Annual Maturity Period Interest Rate for the next succeeding Integral Annual Maturity Period.

MONTHLY PRESENT VALUE
For any month, the sum of the face amounts of bonds in the Theoretical Portfolio for Month plus $100 additional.

WEIGHTED INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
The interest rate for which the present value of the Theoretical Annuity equals the Monthly Present Value, calculated to five decimal places and rounded to three decimal places.

GATT INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
Determined for each Experience Month, it is equal to the annual yield on Thirty-year bonds in the Portfolio Basis, as shown in the Source Document (four decimals).

Provided however, that if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service shall specify in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, a different annual interest rate on Thirty-year securities for that month, then the rate so specified shall be the GATT INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH.

VALUATION INTEREST RATE FOR MONTH
The smaller of the Weighted Interest Rate For Month and the GATT Interest Rate For Month.

The Valuation Interest Rate For Month shall apply to retirements in the second succeeding calendar month. For example, the Valuation Interest Rate for January shall be used for retirements between March 1 and March 31, inclusive.
