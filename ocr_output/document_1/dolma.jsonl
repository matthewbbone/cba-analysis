Subject to Section 11.3, written consent of the Participant and the Participant's spouse to the distribution must be obtained not more than 90 days before the commencement of the distribution of any part of the accrued benefit.\n\n6.4 A Vested Former Participant who is reemployed by the Company:\n\n(a) before benefit payments commence, shall accrue additional benefits for Credited Service subsequent to reemployment,\n\n(b) after benefit payments commence, shall accrue additional benefits as if a new employee, but such benefits shall be 100% vested. Benefit payments earned for earlier periods of employment shall not cease because of reemployment.\n\nARTICLE VII. TRANSFER OF EMPLOYMENT\n\n7.1 Effective January 1, 1994, if a Participant transfers to a position or unit not covered under this Plan, no additional benefit accrual (Credited) service will accrue under this Plan. Such Participant shall remain a Participant under this Plan with respect to all provisions except the benefit accrual (Credited) service provisions. If the Participant terminates employment at a later date, and at that time meets the appropriate eligibility requirements for a benefit under this Plan (as such eligibility requirements exist at the date of termination), such Participant shall, upon written application, receive such benefit. There shall be no duplication of benefits under two or more retirement plans of the Company for the same period of Service.\n\n7.2 Any service rendered to any member of a controlled group of corporations which includes the Company (as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and regulations thereunder) shall be considered service with the Company for the purpose of determining Vesting Service under Section 1.2(c).\n\n7.3 Subject to any provision of this Plan which may specifically provide otherwise, effective January 1, 1994, with respect to an individual who first becomes eligible for participation in this Plan on or after January 1, 1994 (whether as a result of a new hire, rehire, or transfer among the controlled group of companies), NO service rendered prior to such new hire; rehire, or transfer, which had previously been counted as benefit accrual (Credited) service under any other Internal Revenue Service qualified retirement plan of the Company (whether or not such\nservice resulted in a vested accrued benefit), shall be considered benefit accrual (Credited) service under this Plan.\n\nARTICLE VIII. JOINT ANNUITY BENEFIT\n\n8.1 A Participant (or Vested Former Participant) may provide for a life income, after retirement, to his or her spouse in the form of a 100% Joint Annuity Benefit. A 100% Joint Annuity Benefit is a reduced monthly payment and is 100% of the actuarial equivalent of the Accrued Benefit (reduced in accordance with Section 4.2, if applicable) at the attained ages of the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) and spouse at the date benefit payments commence. Such 100% Joint Annuity Benefit is payable during the joint lives of the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) and spouse and then so long as either the Participant or the Participant's spouse is alive. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. A dissolution of marriage occurring after July 1, 1986 and after benefit payments have commenced shall have no effect on payments under any optional form of benefit.\n\n8.2 A married Participant (or Vested Former Participant) eligible to receive Normal, Early, or Disability Retirement benefits will automatically receive, unless otherwise rejected, a 100% Joint Annuity Benefit. Instead of that form of benefit, such Participant (or Vested Former Participant) may reject the automatic election and elect to receive the full amount of Accrued Benefit (reduced in accordance with Section 4.2, if applicable) payable during the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) lifetime only or in any other optional form of benefit which is available under the Plan.\n\n8.3 Approximately nine months prior to the date a Participant is first eligible for early retirement, he shall be provided with a general explanation of the description and financial effect of the Joint Annuity Benefit and informed of his right to elect or revoke such annuity. A Participant may also make a written request for the terms, conditions and specific financial effect on his particular annuity. An election or revocation may be made at any time before benefit payments commence, provided that an election NOT to take a Joint Annuity must also be signed by the spouse and witnessed by a Company representative or Notary Public. The waiver of the Joint Annuity Benefit and the spouse's consent thereto must: (1) state the specific nonspouse beneficiary (including any class of beneficiaries or any contingent beneficiaries) who will receive the benefit, and (2) the particular\noptional form of benefit. To make an election, to revoke an election, or to receive any optional form of benefit provided by the Plan, a Participant (or Vested Former Participant) must complete and file with the Retirement Committee the approved form available at all local personnel offices. Subject to Section 11.3, written consent of the Participant and the Participant's spouse to the distribution must be obtained not more than 90 days before the commencement of the distribution of any part of the accrued benefit.\n\nARTICLE VIII A. OTHER OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFIT\n\n8A.1 Subject to Article VIII, a Participant (or Vested Former Participant) may provide for a life income, after retirement, to his or her spouse in the form of a 50% (66-2/3%, 75%) Joint Annuity Benefit. The 50% (66-2/3%, or 75%) Joint Annuity Benefit is a reduced monthly payment and is the actuarial equivalent of the Accrued Benefit (reduced in accordance with Section 4.2, if applicable) at the attained ages of the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) and spouse at the date benefit payments commence. Such 50% (66-2/3%, or 75%) Joint Annuity Benefit is payable during the life of the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) and upon the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) death, 50% (66-2/3%, or 75%) of this amount continues to the spouse, if living. The actuarial equivalent for all optional forms of benefit provided for in this section shall be as specified in Attachment II.\n\n8A.2 Subject to Article VIII, a Participant (or Vested Former Participant) may elect a pension payable in a reduced monthly amount during the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) lifetime, and, in the event of the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) death within a period of ten (five or fifteen) years after the first monthly installment of such pension becomes payable, the same reduced monthly amount shall be payable for the remainder of such ten-year (five-year or fifteen-year) period to a primary beneficiary designated by the Participant (or Vested Former Participant). In the event of the deaths of both the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) and the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) primary beneficiary within a period of ten (five or fifteen) years after the first monthly installment of such pension becomes payable, the commuted value of the balance of payments shall be paid in one lump sum to the secondary\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant (or Vested Former Participant), and if more than one such secondary beneficiary shall survive the Participant's (or Vested Former Participant's) primary beneficiary, payment shall be made in such portions among them as the Participant (or Vested Former Participant) shall have designated; otherwise, each shall receive an equal portion. Such election may be made at any time prior to the date benefit payments commence. The Ten-year (Five-year or Fifteen-year) Certain and Life Thereafter Benefit so payable shall be the actuarial equivalent (computed at the time of retirement) of the benefit otherwise payable thereunder. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. Any election made hereunder may be revoked at any time prior to the date benefit payments commence. The consent of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries will not be required when any revocation of election is made. The \"certain period\" in the optional benefit shall be reduced, when necessary, so that it does not exceed the life expectancy at the date the benefit commences as listed in Attachment II.\n\nARTICLE VIII.B. SOCIAL SECURITY LEVELING OPTION\n\n8B.1(a) Subject to Article VIII, a Participant who is eligible for retirement (but not Disability Retirement) may elect to have his benefit paid under the Social Security Leveling Option, provided such benefit commences prior to the earliest age a reduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount could be paid (currently age 62).\n\n(b) Under the Social Security Leveling Option, the Participant will receive the actuarial equivalent of the Accrued Benefit (reduced in accordance with Section 4.2, if applicable) otherwise payable in amounts which, when combined with the estimated reduced Primary Insurance Amount, will, if sufficient, provide a substantially level total benefit. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. Upon reaching the earliest age a reduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount is payable, the monthly income from the retirement plan shall be reduced by the amount of reduced Primary Insurance Amount used in the calculation of the option benefit.\n\n(c) At the Participant's election, the Social Security Leveling Option may be calculated using any later age prior to the first age an unreduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount\ncould be paid (versus the earliest age a reduced Social Security Primary Insurance Amount could be paid).\n\nARTICLE VIIIIC. LUMP SUM OPTIONS\n\n8C.1 Upon the written request of a Participant who is eligible for early or normal retirement, the Committee shall provide for payment to such Participant of the actuarial equivalent of the benefits otherwise payable to such Participant hereunder in a lump sum payment. A lump sum payment shall be made on the first day of the month following retirement. The actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II. A single lump sum distribution shall be considered as a revocation of the 100% Joint Annuity form of benefit.\n\nARTICLE IX. SURVIVOR BENEFIT (ACTIVE)\n\n9.1 (a) Upon the death of a married Participant while still in the active employ of the Company, at a time when such Participant was at least age 55 and eligible for Early Retirement (as specified in Article IV) the Participant shall be deemed to be covered for a life income to his or her surviving spouse. Such life income is known as an \"AUTOMATIC EARLY SURVIVOR BENEFIT\" and is payable only to the designated spouse (wife or husband) of the Participant.\n\n(b) The amount of an Automatic Early Survivor Benefit shall be 100% of the reduced amount the Participant would have received under a 100% Joint Annuity assuming such Participant had retired the day preceding the date of death under the 100% Joint Annuity Option.\n\n(c) The 100% Joint Annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit otherwise payable under this Plan. The actuarial equivalent shall be on the same actuarial basis as the 100% Joint Annuity in Article VIII.\n\n9.2 (a) Upon the death of a married Participant, while still in the active employ of the Company, at a time when such Participant was vested but not eligible for a benefit under Section 9.1, the Participant shall be deemed to be covered for a life income to his or her surviving spouse. Such life income is known as an \"AUTOMATIC VESTED SURVIVOR BENEFIT\" and is payable only to the designated spouse (wife or husband) of the Participant.\n\n(b) The amount of an Automatic Vested Survivor Benefit shall be 100% of the reduced amount the Participant would have\nreceived under a 100% Joint Annuity assuming such Participant had:\n(i) separated from service on the date of death, and\n(ii) survived until the earliest date a benefit could commence to the Participant as a Vested Former Participant and had retired under the 100% Joint Annuity Option, and\n(iii) died on the day after the 100% Joint Annuity Benefit had commenced.\n\n(c) The actuarial equivalent for early commencement shall be the same as specified for the early commencement of a retirement benefit for a Vested Former Participant. The 100% Joint Annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit otherwise payable under this Plan. The actuarial equivalent shall be on the same actuarial basis as the 100% Joint Annuity in Article VIII.\n\n(d) In lieu of commencing the Vested Survivor Benefit on the earliest date possible, the surviving spouse may elect commencement on any later date the Participant, as a Vested Former Participant, could have elected commencement of a retirement benefit. Subject to Section 11.3, written consent of the surviving spouse to the distribution must be obtained not more than 90 days before the commencement of the distribution of any part of the benefit payable to such spouse.\n\n9.3(a) If ALL of the requirements of 9.3(b) are met, then a Single Parent Preretirement Survivor Benefit will be paid according to Section 9.3(d).\n\n(b) The requirements specified in Section 9.3(a) are:\n(i) an active Participant dies after becoming eligible for early retirement, and\n(ii) there is no surviving spouse eligible for any benefits under the Plan and no other beneficiary is eligible for any benefits under the Plan other than the Single Parent Preretirement Survivor Benefit (excluding refund of employee contributions, if any), and\n(iii) the Participant left one or more Eligible Dependents as defined in Section 9.3(c).\n\n(c) An Eligible Dependent is defined as an individual:\n(i) who was a natural, adopted, step, or foster child of the Participant, for whom the Participant had or shared primary financial responsibility, and\n(ii) who (1) was under the age of nineteen as of the date of death of the Participant or (2) was developmentally disabled to such an extent that, in the sole discretion of the Retirement Committee, such individual was incapable of independent living.\n\n(d) (i) A Single Parent Preretirement Survivor Benefit will be calculated as if the Participant had retired the day before the date of death and had elected payment under a 10 year certain and life thereafter optional form of benefit.\n\n(ii) The certain portion of the Single Parent Preretirement Survivor Benefit will be divided uniformly among all Eligible Dependents.\n\n(iii) Payment will be made to each Eligible Dependent's guardian, if any, otherwise, to the individual who or institution which, in the sole discretion of the Retirement Committee, appears to have accepted responsibility for the care of the Eligible Dependent. The Retirement Committee, in its sole discretion, may change its designation as appropriate.\n\n(iv) If the monthly benefit payable on behalf of any Eligible Dependent is less than $100 per month, the commuted present value will be determined using a 9.5% discount rate and such present value will be paid in a lump sum.\n\n(v) If any certain payments remain upon the death of an Eligible Dependent, then the payments due such Eligible Dependent will be divided uniformly among the original Eligible Dependents then remaining, regardless of current age. Upon the death of the last remaining Eligible Dependent, no further benefits shall be payable.\n\nARTICLE X. DEATH BENEFITS (TERMINATED)\n\n10.1 Any Participant who continues working after Normal Retirement Date or who terminates employment on or after the date all requirements have been satisfied for Early or Normal Retirement (except for any requirement that there be filed a claim for benefits) and who thereafter dies before beginning to receive such benefits will be considered to have retired and elected immediate commencement of benefits as of the date preceding the date of death. Unless rejected prior to date of death, such benefits shall be payable in the form of a 100% Joint Annuity. Any benefit payable under this\nSection shall be in lieu of any benefit payable under Article IX or under Section 10.2 below.\n\n10.2(a) Subject to 10.1 and further provided that the retirement benefit has not yet commenced, a Vested Former Participant shall be deemed to be covered for a life income to his or her surviving spouse in the event of death before retirement. Such life income is known as an \"AUTOMATIC FORMER PARTICIPANT SURVIVOR BENEFIT\" and is payable only to the designated spouse (wife or husband) of the Vested Former Participant.\n\n(b) (i) If the Vested Former Participant was eligible for immediate commencement of his retirement benefit at the time of death, the amount of an Automatic Former Participant Survivor Benefit shall be 100% of the reduced amount the Vested Former Participant would have received under a 100% Joint Annuity assuming such Participant had retired the day preceding the date of death under the 100% Joint Annuity Option.\n\n(ii) If the Vested Former Participant was not yet eligible for immediate commencement of his retirement benefit at the time of death, the amount of an Automatic Former Participant Survivor Benefit shall be 100% of the reduced amount the Vested Former Participant would have received under a 100% Joint Annuity assuming such Participant had:\n\n(A) survived until the earliest date a benefit could commence to the Vested Former Participant and had retired under the 100% Joint Annuity Option, and\n\n(B) died on the day after the 100% Joint Annuity benefit had commenced.\n\n(c) The 100% Joint Annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit otherwise payable under this Plan. The actuarial equivalent shall be on the same actuarial basis as the 100% Joint Annuity in Article VIII.\n\n(d) In lieu of commencing the Automatic Former Participant Survivor Benefit on the earliest date possible, the surviving spouse may elect commencement on any later date the Vested Former Participant could have elected a retirement benefit. Subject to Section 11.3, written consent of the surviving spouse to the distribution must be obtained not more than\n90 days before the commencement of the distribution of any part of the benefit payable to such spouse.\n\nARTICLE XI. PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\n\n11.1 At least 45 days prior to actual retirement, a Participant (or Vested Former Participant) should contact the local personnel office and complete the proper forms to obtain retirement benefits. Upon actual retirement, a Participant (or Vested Former Participant) may be referred to as a \"Retiree\".

The actuarial present value shall be as specified in Attachment II. No distribution shall be made under this provision after an annuity has commenced unless the Participant (and/or spouse as applicable) consents in writing to such distribution. No distribution shall be made under this provision unless the\ndistribution meets all requirements to be considered an \"involuntary cash-out\" under Internal Revenue Code Section 411. Any nonvested terminated employee will be deemed to have received a distribution under this Section 11.3.\n\n11.4 A Participant or spouse who has been denied benefits shall be notified in writing of the specific reasons for such denial, and may submit a written application for review to the Retirement Committee.\n\nARTICLE XII.

All benefits shall be payable only out of the assets in the Trust, except in the event of a Plan termination.\n\n12.3 The Company intends to continue this Plan indefinitely; however, the right is reserved to discontinue contributions or to terminate the Plan.\n\n12.4 The contribution for any year shall be contingent upon the contribution being deductible to the Company under Internal Revenue Code Section 404, except to the extent such contribution may be required to satisfy the top heavy provisions of Article XIX. Should any contribution be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be\nnondeductible (subject to the top heavy required contribution), it shall be returned to the Company following Internal Revenue Service procedures.\n\n12.5 If the Company does not pay Eligible Expenses of the Plan and/or Trust directly, or if the Company pays such expenses and submits a request to the Retirement Committee for reimbursement, the Retirement Committee may authorize the payment of such expenses from trust funds. To qualify as an Eligible Expense, an expense must:\n\n(i) be reasonable and necessary\n(ii) be solely for the benefit of Participants\n(iii) be a direct expense\n(iv) satisfy the exception to Prohibited Transactions provided by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and applicable Department of Labor Regulations and Opinions.\n\nARTICLE XIII.

Replacements for any vacancies in\nthe membership shall be selected by the remaining member or members.\n\nARTICLE XIV. AMENDMENTS\n\n14.1 The Company reserves the right to modify, alter, or amend this Plan, as well as the Master Trust Agreement. Any such action shall comply with applicable laws and regulations and shall not permit funds in the Trust to be used for anything but the exclusive benefit of Retirees, Participants, Vested Former Participants, and their spouses. Amendments may be adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company or such person or persons to which such authority is delegated by the Board of Directors.\n\n14.2 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may make any modifications or amendments of the Plan which it deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Plan to qualify, and continue to qualify, with the Treasury Department under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and with the Treasury Department and the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including any applicable rulings or amendments.\n\nARTICLE XV. TERMINATION\n\n15.1 The Company may terminate this Plan at any time. The Plan may, in any case, be terminated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) if:\n\n(a) the Plan has not met minimum funding standards as defined by law;\n\n(b) the Plan is unable to pay benefits when due;\n\n(c) the possible long-run loss to the above Corporation with respect to the Plan will increase unreasonably if the Plan is not terminated; or\n\n(d) the Company shall go out of existence, unless prior to such event the Plan shall be adopted and continued by a Successor.\n\n15.2 If the Plan terminates, or is partially terminated, each affected Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be nonforfeitable, to the extent funded, and shall be based on Service to the date of termination. The assets in the Trust shall be utilized to pay\nbenefits, to the extent funded, in the following order of preference.\n\n(a) (i) To Retirees, Participants, Vested Former Participants, their spouses or beneficiaries (if payments to a spouse or beneficiary are, or may be, applicable):\n    (A) who had been receiving benefits for the three-year period ending on the date of termination, and\n    (B) who would have been receiving benefits for such period if the Participant, having been eligible for retirement, would have commenced retirement prior to such period and commenced receiving benefits (in the normal form) as of the beginning of such period.\n\n(ii) Those described above in Subsection (a)(i) shall receive a portion of the Accrued Benefit equal to the lesser of:\n    (A) the portion of an Accrued Benefit which was in pay status (at its lowest level during the three-year period) in the case of persons described in Subsection (i)(A) or which would have been in pay status in the case of persons described in Subsection (i)(B), or\n    (B) the portion of an Accrued Benefit which would have been in pay status based on the terms of the Plan in effect during the five-year period prior to the date of termination under which such Accrued Benefit would have been lowest.\n\n(b) To the extent that an Accrued Benefit has not been provided under Subsection (a), the portion of the Accrued Benefit guaranteed under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, without regard to Section 4022(b)(5) thereof.\n\n(c) To the extent that an Accrued Benefit has not been provided under Subsections (a) or (b), the portion of the Accrued Benefit which was nonforfeitable under this Plan immediately prior to the date of termination.\n\n(d) To the extent that an Accrued Benefit has not been provided under Subsections (a), (b), or (c), all other Accrued Benefits under this Plan.\n\n15.3 If all assets available for allocation are not sufficient to cover the full benefits under either Subsection 15.2(a) or (b), the assets must be prorated among the individuals described in\nSubsection 15.2(a) or (b), as the case may be, on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that Subsection.\n\n15.4 If the assets are not sufficient to cover all benefits in Subsection 15.2(c), they must be allocated under the Plan in effect five years prior to termination. If the assets are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits based on that version of the Plan, then they shall be allocated under the most recent version of the Plan under which the assets are sufficient to satisfy in full the liabilities. Any remaining assets are then allocated as they would have been under the next most recent Plan amendment.\n\n15.5 As provided by law, the Company has obtained Plan termination insurance that will insure Participants (or Vested Former Participants) their spouses, and beneficiaries against loss of certain benefits arising in the event of a complete or partial Plan termination. These benefits are insured and, in the event of Plan termination, may be paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if not paid from the Trust. Such benefits may be reduced as provided in the law.\n\n15.6 If the Plan terminates, the Retirement Committee may, if no discrimination results, direct that amounts payable be calculated on an actuarial basis and be paid either in cash or in other assets, including insurance or annuity contracts, as the Retirement Committee in its discretion may determine.\n\n15.7 The Company shall not receive any amount from the Trust, except such amounts as may remain after satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan.\n\nARTICLE XVI. MERGER WITH OTHER PLANS\n\n16.1 In the event the Company shall acquire by purchase, merger, liquidation, or otherwise all or substantially all of the assets of another company, or shall acquire a majority of the shares of another company, having a pension or retirement plan for some or all of its hourly employees, the pension or retirement plan of such other company may, with the consent of Weyerhaeuser Company, be merged into or combined with this Plan, and the assets in the Trust under such other company's plan may be paid over to the Trustee under this Plan.\n\n16.2 In the case of any transfer, merger, or consolidation of another plan into this Plan, each Participant in each plan will\nreceive (if this Plan were terminated immediately after the merger) benefits immediately after the transfer, merger or consolidation which are at least equal to the benefits such Participant was entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the Participant's plan had been terminated). The benefits thereafter payable under this Plan to former participants under the other plan (including retired participants) shall be instead of the benefits that would otherwise be payable to them under the other plan. In the case of participants who had retired prior to the date of such merger, the amount of benefits shall be the same as those under the other plan. Within 30 days of any such merger or transfer of assets, the Administrator must notify the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\nARTICLE XVII. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n17.1 No interest under this Plan or the Master Trust Agreement shall be assignable in anticipation of payment, either by voluntary act or by operation of law, or be liable in any way for the debts or defaults of any beneficiary, except that at the written request of a beneficiary, and subject to the Retirement Committee's approval, appropriate deductions may be made from monthly benefit payments and applied for the beneficiary's account to the payment of part of any Company group medical or hospital insurance then being carried by the beneficiary, provided that the beneficiary may at any time revoke such authorization and that the Company shall not have an enforceable interest in such assignment.\n\n17.2 Neither the establishment, continuation, or termination of the Plan, nor anything contained herein, shall give, or be construed as giving, any Participant a right to be retained in the service of the Company as an employee.\n\nARTICLE XVIII. MAXIMUM BENEFITS\n\n18.1(a) Subject to 18.1(d), the benefit to be provided a Participant, when expressed as a single life annuity annual benefit, shall not exceed the Maximum Benefit described in 18.1(b), as further adjusted by 18.1(c).\n\n(b) (i) The Maximum Benefit described in 18.1(a) shall equal the lesser of:\n\n(A) 100% of the Participant's average compensation for his high three consecutive years of participation, or\n(B) the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation.\n\n(ii) If the annual benefit described in 18.1(a) begins prior to the Participant's Social Security Retirement Age as specified by under Section 216(1) of the Social Security Act (except that such section shall be applied without regard to the age increase factor and as if the early retirement age under Section 216(1)(2) of such act was age 62), then the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be reduced in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall describe.\n\nThe reduction procedure as currently described in Internal Revenue Service Notice 87-21 is as follows:\n\n(A) For a benefit which starts after age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation is reduced by \\(5/9\\) of \\(1\\%\\) for each of the first 36 months and \\(5/12\\) of \\(1\\%\\) for each additional month (but not before age 62) by which the benefit commences before the Social Security retirement age.\n\n(B) For a benefit which starts before age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the reduced Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation at age 62 as determined in (A) above.\n\n(iii) For a benefit which starts after the Social Security retirement age, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation in effect at the Participant's Social Security retirement age.\n\n(iv) For purposes of this Section 18.1(b), the actuarial equivalent shall be as specified in Attachment II.\n\n(c) The Maximum Benefit described in 18.1(b) shall be subject to the following:\n\n(i) The maximum amount shall apply to a single life annuity benefit.\n\n(ii) If the Participant has fewer than ten years of plan participation at retirement, the applicable maximum shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is his plan participation and the denominator of which is ten, provided that said fraction shall in no event be less than \\(1/10\\)th.\n(iii) To the extent required by government regulations, this 18.1(c) shall apply separately to each change in the benefit structure of the plan.\n\n(d) (i) Subject to any reduction required by Section 18.2, the Maximum Benefit shall not be less than the Participant's Accrued Benefit as of December 31, 1982, as determined under the Plan provision and maximum benefit limitations in effect on July 1, 1982 (including any Plan provisions relating to optional forms of benefit or optional retirement dates).\n\n(ii) Subject to any reduction required by Section 18.2, the Maximum Benefit shall not be less than the Participant's Accrued Benefit as of December 31, 1986, as determined under the Plan provisions and maximum benefit limitations in effect on May 5, 1986 (including any Plan provisions relating to optional forms of benefit or optional retirement dates).\n\n(e) Effective January 1, 1994 the Maximum Benefit described in Section 18.1(b) shall be subject to the further limitations specified in this Section 18.1(e).\n\n(i) In the event of plan termination, the benefit of any Highly Compensated (active or former) Employee is limited to a benefit that is nondiscriminatory under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(4). For purposes of this Section 18.1(c) Restricted Employee means any Highly Compensated Employee or former Highly Compensated Employee who, in the year described in Section 18.1(e)(iii), is one of the twenty-five nonexcludable employees and former employees of the Company with the largest amount of compensation in the current or any prior year. For any year a Highly Compensated Employee shall be defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 414(q).\n\n(ii) For any year, the payment of benefits to or on behalf of a Restricted Employee shall not exceed an amount equal to the payments that would be made to or on behalf of the Restricted Employee in that year under:\n\n(A) a straight life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit and other benefits to which the Restricted Employee is entitled under the Plan (other than a Social Security Supplement), and\n(B) a Social Security Supplement, if any, that the Restricted Employee is entitled to receive.\n\n(iii) The restrictions in Section 18.1(e)(ii) do not apply if any one of the following requirements is satisfied:\n\n(A) after taking into account payment to or on behalf of the Restricted Employee of all benefits payable to or on behalf of that Restricted Employee under the Plan, the value of Plan assets equals or exceeds 110% of the value of current liabilities, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 412(1)(7), or\n\n(B) the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Restricted Employee is less than one percent of the value of current liabilities before distribution, or\n\n(C) the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Restricted Employee do not exceed the amount described in Section 11.3.\n\n18.2(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the otherwise permissible annual benefits for any Participant under this Plan shall be further reduced to the extent necessary, as determined by the Retirement Committee, to prevent disqualification of the Plan under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which imposes the following additional limitations on the benefits payable to Participants who also may be participating in another tax qualified pension, profit sharing, saving or stock bonus plan of Weyerhaeuser Company or an affiliated company (\"Employer\"): If an individual is a Participant at any time in both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the Employer, the sum of the defined benefit fraction and the defined contribution fraction for any year may not exceed 1.0.\n\n(b) The defined benefit fraction for any year is a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant's projected annual benefit under the Plan and the denominator of which is the lesser of:\n\n(i) 1.4 multiplied by 100% of the Participant's average compensation for his or her high three consecutive years or\n\n(ii) 1.25 multiplied by the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (but not less than 1.25 multiplied by the larger of (A) the Participant's Accrued Benefit at December 31, 1982, or\n(B) the Participant's Accrued Benefit at December 31, 1986, both as defined in Section 18.1(d)).\n\n(c) Subject to 18.4, the Defined Contribution fraction for any year is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the Participant's account for such year and all prior years and the denominator of which is the Defined Contribution Denominator. The Defined Contribution Denominator is defined as the sum, for such year and all prior years, of the Defined Contribution Yearly Increments. For any year of service the Defined Contribution Yearly Increment is defined as the lesser of:\n\n(i) The product of 1.4 multiplied by 25% of the Participant's compensation for such year and\n\n(ii) The product of 1.25 multiplied by the Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation in effect for such year.\n\n(d) (i) For purposes of the limitations under this Article, all defined benefit plans of the Employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined benefit plan and all defined contribution plans of the Employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined contribution plan.\n\n(ii) For purposes of the limitations under this Article, the words \"Company\" and/or \"Employer\" shall include any employer that, with Weyerhaeuser Company, is a member of a controlled group of corporations or commonly controlled trades or businesses, or a member of an affiliated service group within the meaning of sections 414(b), (c), or (m) and 415(g) and (h) of the Code.\n\n18.3(a) For calendar year 1987, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be $90,000 and the Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation shall be $30,000.\n\n(b) For calendar years after 1987, these dollar limitations shall be automatically adjusted by the cost of living adjustments specified by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(c) For calendar years prior to 1987, the maximum dollar limitations as specified by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code shall continue to apply for each such year.\n\n18.4(a) For purposes of Section 18.2(c), if the Participant was a member in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the Employer which were in existence on July 1, 1982, the\nnumerator of the defined contribution fraction will be adjusted if the sum of this fraction and the defined benefit fraction would otherwise exceed 1.0 under the terms of this Plan. Under the adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess of the sum of the defined contribution and defined benefit fractions over 1.0 times (2) the denominator of the defined contribution fraction will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions as they would be computed as of December 31, 1982.\n\n(b) For purposes of Section 18.2(c), if the Participant was a member in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the Employer which were in existence on May 6, 1986, the numerator of the defined contribution fraction will be adjusted if the sum of defined contribution and defined benefit fractions would otherwise exceed 1.0 under the terms of this Plan. Under the adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess of the sum of the defined contribution and defined benefit fractions over 1.0 times (2) the denominator of the defined contribution fraction will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions as they would be computed as of December 31, 1986, in accordance with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and in accordance with Section 1106(i)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. (Refer to Internal Revenue Service Notice 87-21.)\n\n18.5(a) For purposes of determining the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) compensation shall include basic salary, plus overtime, commissions, and bonuses actually paid.\n\n(b) For years beginning on January 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 1994, compensation described in (a) above shall be limited to $200,000. This limitation shall be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as under Section 415(d) of the Code. For years before 1989 the $200,000 limit shall apply. The accrued benefit of any individual affected by this limit shall not be less than it was December 31, 1988 without application of the limit.\n\n(c) For years beginning on or after January 1, 1994 compensation described in (a) shall be limited to $150,000. This limitation shall be adjusted for the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. For years before 1994 the\n$150,000 limit shall apply. The accrued benefit of any individual affected by this limit shall not be less than it was December 31, 1993 without application of this limit.\n\nARTICLE XIX. TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS\n\n19.1 If the Plan is or becomes top heavy in any Plan year beginning after December 31, 1983, the provisions of this Article will supersede any conflicting provisions in the Plan.\n\n19.2 Definitions:\n(a) Key employee: Any employee or former employee (and the beneficiaries of such employee) who at any time during the determination period was an officer of the employer, (excluding officers who earn less than 150% of the Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation as defined in Article XVIII) an owner (or considered an owner under Section 318 of the Code) of one of the ten largest interests in the employer if such individual's compensation exceeds the dollar limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code, a five percent owner of the employer, or a one percent owner of the employer who has an annual compensation of more than $150,000. No more than 50 employees shall be considered key employees by reason of being an officer of the employer. These 50 employees shall include those key employees or former key employees who had the largest annual compensation during the determination period. The determination period of the Plan is the Plan year containing the determination date and the four preceding Plan years. The determination of who is a key employee will be made in accordance with Section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.\n\n(b) Top heavy Plan: For any Plan year beginning after December 31, 1983, this Plan is top heavy if any of the following conditions exist:\n(i) If the top heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan is not part of any required aggregation group or permissive aggregation group of plans,\n(ii) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group of plans (but which is not part of a permissive aggregation group) and the top heavy ratio for the group of plans exceeds 60 percent, or\n(iii) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group of plans and part of a permissive aggregation group and the\ntop heavy ratio for the permissive aggregation group exceeds 60 percent.\n\n(c) Top heavy ratio: A fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the defined contribution plans for all key employees and the present value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plans for all key employees, and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the defined contribution plans for all Participants and the present value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plans for all Participants. Both the numerator and denominator of the top heavy ratio are adjusted for any distribution of an account balance or an accrued benefit made in the five-year period ending on the determination date and any contribution due but unpaid as of the determination date.\n\nThe value of account balance and the present value of accrued benefits will be determined as of the most recent valuation date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the determination date. The account balances and accrued benefits of a Participant who is not a key employee but who was a key employee in a prior year will be disregarded. The calculation of the top heavy ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Section 416 of the Code and the regulation thereunder. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top heavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the determination dates that fall within the same calendar year.\n\n(d) Permissive aggregation group: The required aggregation group of plans plus any other plan or plans of the employer which, when considered as a group with the required aggregation group, would continue to satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.\n\n(e) Required aggregation group: (1) Each qualified plan of the employer in which at least one key employee participates, and (2) any other qualified plan of the employer which enables a plan described in (1) to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code.\n(f) Determination date: For any Plan year subsequent to the first Plan year, the last day of the preceding Plan year. For the first Plan year of the Plan, the last day of that year.\n\n(g) Valuation date: The date as of which account balances or accrued benefits are valued for purposes of calculating the top heavy ratio. The valuation date shall be the same date as used for computing Plan costs for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is performed that year.\n\n(h) Present value: Present value shall be based only on the interest and mortality rates specified in Attachment II.\n\n(i) Code: The Internal Revenue Code as amended from time to time.\n\n19.3 Minimum accrued benefit:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan except (c) below, for any Plan year in which this Plan is top heavy, each Participant who is not a key employee and has completed 1,000 hours of service will accrue a benefit (to be provided solely by employer contributions and expressed as a life annuity commencing at normal retirement age) of not less than two percent of his or her highest average compensation for the five consecutive years for which the Participant had the highest compensation. The minimum accrual is determined without regard to any social security contribution. The minimum accrual applies even though under other Plan provisions the Participant would have received a lesser accrual for the year.\n\n(b) For purposes of computing the minimum accrued benefit, compensation will include W-2 wages from the employer for the calendar year ending with or within the Plan year. Compensation for this section will be subject to the compensation limits described in Section 18.5.\n\n(c) No additional benefit accruals shall be provided pursuant to (a) above to the extent that the total accruals on behalf of the Participant attributable to employer contributions will provide a benefit expressed as a life annuity commencing at normal retirement age that equals or exceeds 20 percent of the Participant's highest average compensation for the five consecutive years for which the Participant had the highest compensation.\n\n(d) If the form of benefit is other than a single-life annuity, the employee must receive an amount that is the actuarial\nequivalent of the minimum single-life annuity benefit. If the benefit commences at a date other than at normal retirement age, the employee must receive at least an amount that is the actuarial equivalent of the minimum single-life annuity benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\n\n19.4(a) The nonforfeitable interest of each employee in his employer-derived accrued benefits shall be 100 percent vested after three years of vesting service.\n\n(b) For any Plan year in which this Plan is top heavy, the vesting schedule in (a) will automatically apply to the Plan. The minimum vesting schedule applies to all benefits within the meaning of Section 411(a)(7) of the Code except those attributable to employee contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective date of Section 416 and benefits accrued before the Plan became top heavy. Further, no reduction in vested benefits may occur in the event the Plan's status as top heavy changes for any Plan year. However, this section does not apply to the accrued benefits of any employee who does not have an hour of service after the Plan has initially become top heavy and such employee's accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions will be determined without regard to this section.\n\n(c) If the vesting schedule under the Plan shifts in or out of the schedule in (a) above for any Plan year because of the Plan's top heavy status, such shift is an amendment to the vesting schedule and the right of election of Section 411(a)(10)(B) of the Code shall apply.\n\n(d) The minimum accrued benefit required (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code 416(b)) may not be forfeited under Code 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).\n\n19.5 In any Plan year in which the Plan is top heavy, the figure \"1.25\" in Article XVIII, as it relates to the maximum benefit dollar limitations under Section 415 of the Code, shall be changed to \"1.0.\"\n\nARTICLE XX: RETIREE BENEFIT CHANGES\n\n20.1 Effective March 1, 1993, provided ALL of the eligibility requirements of Section 20.2 have been met, the monthly retirement benefit will be increased in accordance with Section 20.3.\n\n20.2 The eligibility requirements include the following:\n(a) The employee must have retired in 1987 or before.\n\n(b) The employee must have had at least 10 years of service for benefit accrual (Credited Service) at the time of retirement.\n\n(c) As of January 1, 1993, the individual receiving the benefit (retiree or beneficiary) must be at least 55 years of age (born in 1937 or before).\n\n(d) If a benefit is being paid to an alternate payee solely as a result of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, such alternate payee shall not be eligible for any benefit increase.\n\n20.3(a) Provided the employee did not retire from New Freedom or Riverside, or elect a Social Security Leveling Option, the increase in benefit shall be calculated according to the following steps:\n\n(i) An initial amount will be determined equal to $75.00 less the current monthly benefit (but not less than zero).\n\n(ii) An additional amount will be determined equal to the number of years of Credited Service in excess of 10 years (but not more than 10 years) times $1.00. (That is, this amount is limited to $10.00).\n\n(iii) An additional amount will be determined equal to \"1988 less the year of retirement\" times $1.25.\n\n(iv) Find the sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) and then limit this sum to a maximum of $60.00.\n\n(v) The increase in benefit shall be equal to the larger of the amount in (iv) or $10.00 per month.\n\n(b) For employees who retired from New Freedom or Riverside and who did not elect a Social Security Leveling Option, the increase in benefit shall be calculated according to the following:\n\n(i) An initial amount will be determined to equal $75.00 less the current monthly benefit (but not less than zero).\n\n(ii) The amount in (i) shall be limited to a maximum of $60.00 per month.\n\n(iii) The increase in benefit shall be equal to the larger of the amount in (ii) or $10.00 per month.\n\n(c) For employees who elected a Social Security Leveling Option and who are currently receiving a benefit, the current benefit shall be increased $10.00 per month. If the date as of which the company-paid benefit is coordinated with social security\nis after March 1, 1993 and the company-paid benefit after the coordination date (but before any ad hoc adjustment) is greater than zero, then the company-paid benefit after the coordination date shall also be increased by $10.00 per month. If the benefit after the coordination date (and before any ad hoc adjustment) was calculated as zero it shall remain zero.\n\nARTICLE XXI. DIRECT TRUSTEE TO TRUSTEE ROLLOVERS\n\n21.1 This Article applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election under this Article, a Distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover.\n\n21.2 An Eligible Rollover Distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).\n\n21.3 An Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to the surviving spouse, an Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.\n21.4 A Distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are Distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.\n\n21.5 A Direct Rollover is a payment by the plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.\n\n21.6 Code is the Internal Revenue Code as it may be amended from time to time.\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY\nRETIREMENT PLAN FOR HOURLY RATED EMPLOYEES\nPART 03\nNORTHWEST PULP AND PAPERBOARD OPERATIONS\n\nSCHEDULE A\n\nThe operating units of the Company referred to in Section I of the Plan, each of which is defined in the Plan as a qualified unit, are the following:\n\n1.

Effective for terminations on or after January 1, 1996:\n(1) Refer to item 6(b) below, but substitute Section 11.3 for 8C.1.\n\n5. For purposes of Article XVIII:\na. The actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Benefit for commencement prior to age 62 shall be determined from a sex-neutral mortality table based on the Applicable Mortality Tables in (c) below, weighted 50% for males and 50% for females, respectively, using an interest rate equal to the greater of 5.0% and the interest rate used to determine the optional form of benefit, if any.\n\nb. The actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Benefit for commencement after the Social Security Retirement Age shall be determined from a sex-neutral mortality table based on the Applicable Mortality Tables in (c) below, weighted 50% for males and 50% for females, respectively, with a 5.0% interest assumption. Provided, however, that if the Participant elects a form of benefit other than a single life annuity, the interest rate will be the smaller of 5.0% and the interest rate used to determine the optional form of benefit.\n\nc. The Applicable Mortality Tables shall be as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall be based on the prevailing Commissioners Standard Tables found in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts (without regard to any other subparagraph of Section 807(d)(5). As of January 1, 1995 the Applicable Mortality Tables were the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Tables for males and females.\nd. When converting an optional form of benefit back into a single life annuity for purposes of applying the Maximum Benefit limitations of Article XVIII, the following rules shall apply:\n\n(1) When Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply (example: non-decreasing annuities), the equivalent annual single life annuity shall be the greater of: (1) the equivalent annual benefit computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified in the Plan for the particular optional form of benefit, and (2) the equivalent annual benefit computed using 5.0% interest and the Applicable Mortality Tables specified in (c) above, weighted 50% for males and 50% for females.\n\n(2) When Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e)(3) does apply (example: lump sum benefits), the equivalent annual single life annuity shall be the greater of: (1) the equivalent annual benefit computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified in the Plan for the particular optional form of benefit, and (2) the equivalent annual benefit computed using the GATT Interest Rate For Month (specified in Attachment III and applied as if it were the Valuation Interest Rate For Month with two month lag until termination date) and the Applicable Mortality Table specified in (c) above, weighted 50% for males and 50% for females.\n\n6. a. Effective for terminations on or before December 31, 1995:\n(1) For purposes of Section 8C.1 the actuarial equivalent shall be determined from a sex-neutral mortality table based on the male and female 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Tables weighted 90% for males and 10% for females, respectively. The interest rate for termination in any calendar month shall be as further defined in Attachment III. The actuarial equivalent as determined by the preceding shall be reduced by a further 5% discount to reflect the actuarially estimated impact of adverse selection against the Plan.\n\nb. Effective for terminations on or after January 1, 1996:\n(1) For purposes of Section 8C.1 the actuarial equivalent shall be determined based on the Applicable Mortality Table specified in item 5(c) above weighted 50% males and 50% females and the Valuation Interest Rate For\nMonth (after two month lag applied to termination date) as specified in Attachment III.\n7.

To help in this task, Weyerhaeuser and your bargaining representatives started a savings plan on October 1, 1988, to benefit you as an hourly Weyerhaeuser employee. This savings plan provides you with a convenient tax-sheltered way to save for your long-term goals. The name of the plan is the Weyerhaeuser company Hourly 401(k) Plan, AWPPW.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS), through the use of tax-deferred savings plans known as 401(k) plans, permits the deferral of income taxes on dollars saved. Your plan is a 401(k) plan. It is a voluntary program that offers you an easy, convenient way to prepare for your future financial needs.\n\nHighlights\n\u2022 You can defer from 1 to 14 percent of your pay through convenient payroll deductions.\n\u2022 Your money is invested as you choose in any of five investment objectives.\n\u2022 Your current taxes are reduced because you contribute to the plan on a before-tax basis, and your investment earnings accumulate tax-deferred.\n\nThe Company adds to your deferral with a matching contribution. The Company contribution is in the form of Weyerhaeuser Company Stock.\n\nEligibility and Enrollment\nYou are eligible to join the plan after one year of service. Your participation is voluntary. You may join the plan any month following the date you become eligible. To join the plan, complete a 401(k) Application for Participation form (#10266) and submit it to the Investment Growth Department, TF 6F, Tacoma WA 98477. These forms are available from your human resource representative.\nFor a complete description of the Plan, you may obtain a Summary Plan Description (SPD) by calling the Benefits Information Center at (206) 924-4800 or from your local human resource representative.\nHEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR WEYERHAEUSER PAPER COMPANY HOURLY RATED EMPLOYEES AND DEPENDENTS PULP AND PAPERBOARD DIVISION WASHINGTON AND OREGON\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nSummary Plan Description ................................................................. 158\nWho Is Eligible ............................................................................. 160\nWhen Coverage Begins ................................................................. 162\nHow Benefits are Paid ................................................................. 162\nWhat the Deductible Is ............................................................... 163\nWhat Charges Are Covered ......................................................... 163\nWhat \"Usual and Customary or Reasonable\" Means ..................... 163\nWhat Medically Necessary Means .............................................. 165\nHow Covered Charges Are Paid ............................................... 165\nLimitations and Exclusions .......................................................... 168\nWhat If You are Eligible for Benefits From Other Sources? .......... 170\nWhat If You are Eligible for Medicare? ....................................... 172\nDefinitions .................................................................................. 172\nHow to File a Claim ..................................................................... 174\nReview of Denied Claims ............................................................ 175\nRelease of Medical Records ........................................................ 175\nService Area ................................................................................. 175\nCessation of Active Work ........................................................... 175\nSelf Payment Notification Process ............................................... 179\nExtended Coverage ................................................................. 180\nConversion of Coverage ............................................................ 180\nMedical Service Plans ............................................................... 181\nSUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION\n\nName of Plan\n    Welfare Benefit Plan\n\nEmployer Identification Number\n    91-0470860\n\nPlan Number\n    582\n\nPlan Administrator\n    Weyerhaeuser Company, Tacoma, Washington 98401\n    Telephone (206) 924-2345\n\nContributions\n    The premiums for your benefits under the plan are paid from employer and employee contributions.\n\nPlan Records\n    The fiscal records for the Plan are kept on an annual basis ending on each December 31.\n\nParticipants Included\n    The benefits in this Summary apply to all hourly rated employees of the Weyerhaeuser Company located at Cosmopolis, and Longview, Washington (except employees of the #2 paper mill), and at Springfield, Oregon, represented by the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers.\n\nEffective Date\n    January 1, 1985, or on the first day of your active employment, whichever is the later date.\n\nBenefits\n    This Plan provides health care benefits.

The employee's lawful spouse.\nB. Any unmarried dependent child who is:\n   \u2022 Less than 26 years of age, permanently residing in the employee's household, and claimed as an exemption on the employee's federal income tax return; or\n   \u2022 Less than 26 years of age and legally entitled to medical coverage under a court decree; or\n   \u2022 Developmentally or physically disabled, incapable of self-sustaining employment, and chiefly dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance. Such child will be eligible for coverage past age 26 if:\n      \u2022 The dependent was disabled prior to reaching the limiting age; and\n      \u2022 Proof of such developmental or physical disability and dependence is provided to the Medical Service Plan within 31 days after the dependent reaches the limiting age, and subsequently thereafter as required by the Medical Service Plan, subject to state laws.\nIf the incapacitated child's coverage ceases for any reason, he/she will not thereafter be eligible for coverage under this Plan.\n\nNOTE: No person will be eligible for dependent coverage while covered as an employee under this Plan.\n\nDependent's Effective Date\nCoverage for eligible dependents will begin on the date the employee's coverage becomes effective.\nIf a dependent is acquired after the employee's coverage has become effective, the new dependent should be enrolled within 31 days after acquisition (provided the employee's coverage is in effect at that time).\nA newly-acquired dependent also includes a family member who is returning to a dependent status and a person returning from an employee (of Weyerhaeuser) status.\nA newborn child is eligible for coverage at birth and should be enrolled within 31 days from date of birth.\nIt is essential that you promptly enroll newly-acquired dependents. Failure to do so may delay the processing of any claims. To enroll new dependents, contact your personnel office.\nIn an employee's dependent (other than a newborn child) is confined in a hospital on the date coverage would otherwise become effective, coverage\nwill be postponed until the patient is discharged from the hospital. If the patient's hospital stay is extended by a new condition, which is unrelated to the condition causing the original hospitalization, benefits will be paid for the new condition.\n\nWHEN COVERAGE BEGINS\n\nCoverage for all current employees and their eligible dependents will begin on the effective date of the Plan.\n\nCOST OF COVERAGE\n\nIn the event that the composite premium cost (including HMOs) exceeds $350 per month per employee, employees shall share 50% of any such excess cost, up to a maximum of $17.50/month. (Effective 1/1/99, the employee premium sharing cap will increase to $35.00/month.) For employees opting for alternate coverage plans, the \"monthly premium cost of the health care plan provided by the Company\" shall be the Company-paid portion of the composite premium. The employee contribution shall be withheld on a pre-tax basis.\n\nHOW BENEFITS ARE PAID\n\nThe Plan will pay 100% of the eligible covered charges for:\n\n\u2022 Pre-admission testing\n\u2022 Voluntary secondary surgical opinions\n\u2022 Home health care\n\u2022 Outpatient surgery (including both provider and facility expenses)\n\nFor all other covered charges, the calendar year deductible explained below must be satisfied; then the Plan will pay 80%.\n\nIf, during any calendar year, the employee incurs covered out-of-pocket expenses, including the deductible, in the amount shown in the following schedule, then, for the remainder of that calendar year all covered charges incurred by the employee will be paid at 100%. If, during any calendar year, the employee's eligible dependents, as a group, incur covered out-of-pocket expenses, including the deductible, in the amount shown in the following schedule, then, for the remainder of that calendar year all covered charges incurred by eligible dependents will be paid at 100%.\nSchedule of Out-Of-Pocket Expense Maximum\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Effective Date</th>\n    <th>Employee</th>\n    <th>All Eligible Dependents</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>January 1, 1986</td>\n    <td>$1,000.00</td>\n    <td>$1,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>January 1, 1999</td>\n    <td>$1,250.00</td>\n    <td>$1,250.00</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe maximum lifetime benefit for any individual covered by the Plan is $500,000.00. Each January 1, the amount of benefits used during the preceding year will be automatically reinstated up to a maximum of $5,000.00. However, upon submission of evidence of insurability acceptable to the insurance carrier or Plan administrator, the lifetime maximum will be reinstated.\n\nWHAT THE DEDUCTIBLE IS\n\n$150 deductible for period January 1986 through end of contract.\n\nThis Plan has a $150.00, effective January 1, 1986, calendar year deductible for the employee and a $150.00, effective January 1, 1986, calendar year deductible for all eligible dependents as a group. Benefits are not payable until the deductible amount is satisfied (except as noted on the previous page).\n\nEffective January 1, 1999, the calendar year deductible for the employee will be $200.00. Effective January 1, 1999, the calendar year deductible for all eligible dependents as a group will be $200.00.\n\nAny covered charges incurred in the last three months of a calendar year which are applied to the deductible for that year will also apply towards the deductible for the following year.\n\nWHAT CHARGES ARE COVERED\n\nThe Plan covers the usual and customary or reasonable charges for services, supplies or treatment as listed on pages 192-194, resulting from pregnancy, nonoccupational sickness or nonoccupational accidental injury. In addition, the charge must be:\n\n\u2022 Incurred while you are covered by this Plan, and\n\u2022 Considered medically necessary in the diagnosis or treatment of pregnancy, sickness or injury.\n\nWHAT \"USUAL AND CUSTOMARY OR REASONABLE\" MEANS\n\nUsual - An amount a professional provider usually charges for a given service.\nCustomary _ An amount which falls within the range of charges for a given service billed by most professional providers in the same locality who have similar training and experience.\n\nReasonable _ An amount which is usual and customary or which would not be considered excessive in a particular case because of unusual circumstances.\n\nParticipating professional provider means a professional provider who has an effective participating agreement with Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield.\n\nProfessional Provider _ Means any of the following, from medically necessary services which are within the scope of the provider's state license or registry:\n\n\u2022 A physician (doctor of medicine or osteopathy);\n\u2022 A dentist (doctor of medical dentistry or doctor of dental surgery), but only for treatment of accidental injury to natural teeth or fractured jaw rendered within 12 months after the injury, or for surgery that does not involve repair, removal or replacement of teeth, gums or supporting tissue;\n\u2022 A psychologist, optometrist, optician, chiropractor, naturopath, podiatrist, audiologist, Christian Science Practitioner or chiropodist;\n\u2022 A state-registered clinical social worker, but only for services rendered upon the written referral of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy or a psychologist;\n\u2022 A certified nurse practitioner;\n\u2022 A registered physical, occupational, speech or audiological therapist, but only for rehabilitative services rendered upon the written referral of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy;\n\u2022 A registered nurse or licensed practical nurse, but only for services rendered upon the written referral of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, and only for those services for which nurses customarily bill patients.\n\nThe term \"professional provider\" does not include any classes of provider not named above, and no benefit of the Plan will be paid for their services\n\nCovered Charges _ The following are covered charges under this Plan when incurred for the services and supplies listed in this agreement and when medically necessary for diagnosis and/or treatment of an illness or injury. Refer to pages 192-194 for an explanation on how benefits are paid.\n\n\u2022 The reasonable charge for listed services and supplies provided by a participating facility;\n\u2022 The filed fee approved by a Blue Cross/Blue Shield organization for listed services rendered by a participating professional provider;\n\u2022 The usual and customary or reasonable charge for listed services rendered by non-participating professional providers;\n\u2022 The reasonable charge for all other listed services and supplies.\n\nThe important difference between the benefits for participating providers and non-participating providers is the balance the employee may be required to pay. Once the deductible is satisfied, the balance which the employee may be required to pay to a participating provider will not exceed 20% of the participating provider's charge.\n\nWHAT MEDICALLY NECESSARY MEANS\n\nMedically necessary means those services and supplies that are required for diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury and which are:\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.\n\u2022 Appropriate with regard to standards of good medical practice;\n\u2022 Not primarily for the convenience of the patient or a provider of services or supplies; and\n\u2022 The least costly of the alternative supplies or levels of service which can be safely provided. When specifically applied to a hospital inpatient, it further means that the services or supplies cannot be safely provided in other than a hospital setting without adversely affecting the patient's condition or the quality of medical care rendered.\n\nMedically necessary care does not include care that is primarily custodial care. This is care that helps a person conduct activities of daily living and that can be provided by people without medical or paramedical skills; for example, help in bathing, eating, dressing or getting in or out of bed. Custodial care also includes care that is primarily for the purpose of separating a patient from others or preventing a patient from harming himself/herself.\n\nHOW COVERED CHARGES ARE PAID\n\nThe Plan will pay:\nA. 100% of the usual and customary or reasonable expenses for:\n\u2022 Pre-admission testing performed in a doctor's office, clinic or a hospital on an outpatient basis.

Here are descriptions of the situations that may arise and how the Plan will deal with them.\n\nThird Party Liability\n\nThere may be situations in which a person (an employee or an eligible dependent) may have a legal right to recover the costs of his/her health care from a third party who may be responsible for the illness or injury. For example, if a person was injured in a store, the owner may be responsible for the health care expenses arising out of the injury. As another example, if a person becomes sick or is injured as a result of, or in the course of, employment or self-employment, the employer or a workers' compensation insurer may be responsible for health care expenses from the illness or injury.\n\nIf this Plan paid any benefits, it will be entitled to recover the amount paid from the proceeds of any settlement or recovery received from the third party.\n\nMotor Vehicle Coverage\n\nThis Plan will not pay benefits for health care costs to the extent that they are covered by motor vehicle insurance. But the Plan will pay expenses over the amount covered by the motor vehicle insurance.\n\nCoordination of Benefits\n\nA person may have other health plans or programs that duplicate benefits provided by this plan. When a person is covered under more than one plan, medical expenses are first considered by the \"primary plan\". Any remaining covered charges may then be considered by the \"secondary plan\".\n\nIf this plan is determined to be secondary, claims should be sent to the \"primary plan\" first. This plan's payment will then be limited to what this plan would have paid if it were primary less whatever is paid by the other (primary) plan. (For individuals at the Cosmopolis operation, this plan's payment will be limited to the amount not paid by the primary plan but in no case more than the usual and customary or reasonable charge for a covered expense from all sources except an individual or family (non-group) health insurance policy.\n\nFor purposes of this provision, the following sources of benefits are all considered health plans or programs:\n\n- Group blanket or franchise health insurance policies issued by insurers or health care service contractors;\nPrepaid coverage under service plan contracts or group or individual practice plans;\n\nLabor management trustee plans, labor organization plans, employer organization plans or employee benefit organization plans;\n\nGovernment programs; and\n\nCoverage required or provided by any statute.\n\nThis Plan will use certain rules to coordinate benefits, that is, to decide which plan or program should pay first during a particular period. The period used for calculating benefits under this Plan (called a \"claim determination period\") is the calendar year.\n\nThe rules for coordination of benefits are:\n\nA. If the other plan does not have a \"coordination of benefits\" provision, that plan is primary and must consider coverage first.\n\nB. If the other plan has a \"coordination of benefits\" provision, the plan that covers the person as an employee is primary and must consider coverage first.\n  \u2022 If the person is covered by one of the contracts as an employee rather than as a dependent, that contract is the primary plan and must pay first.\n  \u2022 Birthday rule: If a child is covered by both spouses plans, the plan of the parent whose birth month and day is earlier in the year is primary and must consider coverage first. For example, if the employee's birth month and day is March 15 and the spouse's birth month and day is January 3, the spouse's plan is primary for the child and must consider coverage first.\n    \u2022 If the parent with custody of the child has not remarried, that parent's plan pays first.\n    \u2022 For children of divorced parents, the following rules apply:\n      - If the parent with the custody of the child has not remarried, that parent's plan is primary, followed by the plan of the parent without custody (if any), and last by the plan of the step-parent without custody (if any).\n      - If the parent with custody has remarried, that parent's plan pays first, followed by the plan of the step-parent with custody (if any), followed then by the plan of the parent without custody (if any), and last by the plan of the step-parent without custody (if any).\n    However, if there is a court order that assigns financial responsibility for the medical expenses of the child to one of the natural parents, regardless of\nwhich parent has custody, that parent's plan is primary.\n\n\u2022 If none of the previous rules under B applies, then the contract that has covered the person for the longer period *is* the primary policy and must pay first.\n\nThe Plan can release or obtain any information necessary to determine the coordination of benefits. And the employee or any insured dependent must supply the Plan with any information or releases needed for this purpose.\n\nCorrection of Payments. If another plan makes payments this Plan should have made under this coordination provision, this Plan can reimburse the other plan directly. Any such reimbursement payments will count as benefits paid under this Plan, and will be released from liability to the employee regarding them.\n\nIf this Plan makes payments that should have been made by another plan, it will have the right to recover them from the person for or for whom they were made, or from insurance companies or other organizations. The person involved must sign any documents that are necessary to enforce the Plan's rights under this provision.\n\nWHAT IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE?\n\nAs a general rule, this Plan is secondary to Medicare and will not pay benefits toward any part of a covered expense to the extent the covered expense is actually paid or would have been paid under Medicare Part A or B had the eligible insured employee or insured dependent properly enrolled and applied for benefits.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this general rule. In the following two situations, this Plan will be primary and will not reduce benefits because of Medicare:\n\n\u2022 For covered employees age 65 through 69 who are actively at work and insured spouses age 65 through 69 when the insured employee elects in writing to make this Plan primary over Medicare.\n\u2022 For covered employees or insured dependents who incur covered expenses for kidney transplant or kidney dialysis when by law Medicare is secondary to employee group health plans.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nThe following are definitions of some important terms used in the Plan booklet:\n\nA HOSPITAL is an institution that provides diagnostic and treatment facilities for inpatient surgical and medical care of persons who are injured or ill.

The facility must be licensed by the appropriate state agency to provide such care.\n\nHOW TO FILE A CLAIM\n\nParticipating Providers _ You will receive an identification card which includes the employee's name and social security number, the group name and group number, and the Medical Service Plan number. The card should be presented to the participating provider when treatment is received. Participating providers will normally bill the Medical Service Plan directly and will receive payment directly from the Medical Service Plan. There will be no claim form to fill out.\n\nNon-Participating Providers _ You must file a claim for services by a non-participating provider. The claim must include the following: an itemized statement from the provider, the employee's name and social security number, the patient's name if the claim is for a dependent, and the group name and group number.\n\nIf the provider's statement indicates that the bill has been paid in full, the reimbursement check will be made out to the employee. If no proof-of-payment is furnished, the reimbursement check will name the employee and provider as co-payees.\n\nSpecial claim forms are available for prescription drug claims.\nNOTE: It is your responsibility to determine if the provider is a participating provider. All claims must be submitted within twelve months of the date of service in order to be processed.\n\nREVIEW OF DENIED CLAIMS\n\nIf a claim is denied or partially denied and you feel this decision should be reviewed, write to the Medical Service Plan within 60 days of the date of rejection.

Any such person also authorizes any provider of care, government agency or insurance carrier to release his/her medical records to WPS or the Medical Service Plans. Any information obtained will be kept confidential.\n\nSERVICE AREA\n\nAll counties in Washington (except Yakima County) and Lane and Coos Counties in Oregon are included. Because there is no Medical Service Plan in Yakima County writing prepaid health contracts, Washington Physicians Service cannot guarantee that the physicians in Yakima County will accept its benefits as payment in full for their services. All other benefits of the Plan are available in Yakima County. (Claims for services in this area are processed by King County Medical Blue Shield.)\n\nCESSATION OF ACTIVE WORK\n\nThe employee's and dependent's health care coverage will be canceled as of the end of the day an employee is terminated from the payroll of the Company.\n\nWhen the employee-employer relationship has not been terminated, but the employee is not actively at work, health care coverage will be subject to the following conditions:\nA. Occupational Disability _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of an occupational accident or disease as recognized by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries or the Oregon Workers' Compensation Board, suffered during the course of his/her employment with the Company, health care coverage for the employee and any eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company during the period he/she is disabled from work up to a maximum of twenty-four months following the month in which the disability began. If the employee continues to be disabled from work beyond twenty-four months, and the employee-employer relationship is not terminated, these coverages will be canceled unless the employee elects to continue such coverage by paying the premiums.\n\nB. Non-Occupational Disability _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of non-occupational accident or sickness, health care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company during the period he/she is disabled from work up to a maximum of twelve months following the month in which the disability began. If the employee continues to be disabled beyond twelve months, these coverages will be continued only if the employee elects to continue such coverages with the premium paid for by the employee. Coverage may be continued for up to six months or until the employee-employer relationship is terminated, whichever is the longest.\n\nC. Layoff _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of a layoff due to disciplinary action or lack of work, health care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company for a period of two months following the month in which the layoff or personal leave of absence began.

Disability Retirement - Any employee who retires under the disability provisions of the pension plan may continue group Hospital-Surgical-Medical coverage for himself/herself and eligible dependents, the premium paid by the Company for twenty-nine (29) months from the date of retirement or until he is eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs sooner.\n\nGroup health care coverage for the spouse and eligible dependents will be continued, the premium paid by the Company until the spouse reaches age 65 or becomes eligible and covered by Medicare, whichever occurs first.\n\nH. Death of an Employee\n\nI. When an employee dies as a result of an industrial accident while actively employed by the Company, OR that employee, at the time of death, is eligible for early retirement, group health care coverage will continue for the spouse and dependent children who continue to be eligible under the respective plan definitions until either the spouse remarries, is covered by another group\nhealth care program sponsored by another company, or is eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs first.\n\nIf coverage terminates because the spouse remarries, the spouse will be eligible to continue coverage by self-paying the full monthly cost if:\na. he or she is not covered by another group health care plan, and\nb. less than 36 months have elapsed since the employee's death.\nIn this event the spouse can self-pay for continued coverage only through the 36th month following the day the employee died.\n\n2. If the employee was not eligible for early retirement and the death was as a result of non-industrial cause, coverage for eligible dependents will continue for six months following the month in which the death occurs. Coverage can then be continued for up to an additional 30 months by self-paying the full monthly cost.\n\nEligibility for continued coverage on a self-payment basis will end on the earliest of:\na. the 30-month period indicated above, or\nb. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or\nc. the date a person becomes covered under another group health care plan, or\nd. in the case of a spouse, the date such spouse remarries and becomes covered under another group health care plan, or\ne. the date the plan terminates.\n\n1.

Strike, Lockout or Other Labor Dispute\n\nAn employee may make payment of premiums directly to Weyerhaeuser Company for a period not exceeding six months, in the event of suspension of compensation because of a lockout, strike or other labor dispute. It is the responsibility of the employer to immediately notify the employees of their right to make payments when their compensation is so suspended or terminated.\n\nL. Termination\n\nIn an employee loses coverage because his or her employment terminates (other than gross misconduct) or because work hours are reduced, the employee can continue coverage for self and eligible dependents by paying the full monthly cost.

These benefits are available only for the original condition for which you were hospitalized.\n\nIf you or one of your insured dependents is (1) totally disabled and (2) under active treatment by a physician on the date your eligibility for this Plan ends, benefits will continue to be furnished (but only in connection with treatment for the condition causing the total disability) as follows:\n\nEmployee - Benefits will be provided up to six months or until the maximum benefits have been paid, whichever occurs first.\n\nDependents - Benefits will be provided up to three months or until the maximum benefits have been paid, whichever occurs first.\n\nTotal disability shall mean any medically determined condition which prevents the employee or dependent from engaging in any occupation because of physical or mental impairment.

This is necessary to ensure continuous coverage, as individual plans are ordinarily on a calendar month basis.\n\nMEDICAL SERVICE PLANS\n\nThe Medical Service Plans of Washington and Oregon are ready to serve you.

Tell your dentist you are covered by a WDS (or ODS, if applicable) dental program and give your dentist your social security number, the program name, and the number printed on your identification card.\n\nIf your dentist is a member dentist, the dentist will submit claim forms to the appropriate Dental Service Plan and receive payment based on the dentist's filed fees. You are responsible for any balance remaining.\n\nIf your dentist is not a member dentist, it is your responsibility to have the dentist complete a claim form. You are responsible for paying the dentist's bill and for submitting the claim to the Dental Service Plan. Since the Dental Service Plan does not have filing fees for non-member dentists, payment for services performed by a non-member dentist is made to you based upon actual charges, or the fee charged for the same procedure by 51 percent of member dentists in the area, whichever is less. Payment will be issued in the name of both the employee and the dentist.\n\nIf you receive treatment from a dentist outside your normal Dental Service Plan area, it is your responsibility to have the dentist complete a claim form. You are responsible for paying the dentist's bill and for submitting the claim to the Dental Service Plan.\n\nPayment will be based on the dentist's charge, or the amount that would have been payable if treatment had been provided by a member dentist, whichever is less.\n\nYou may obtain claim forms from your employer or the Dental Service Plan. The Plan will not be obligated to pay for treatment performed in the event claim forms are submitted for payment more than six (6) months after the date of rendition of such treatment.\nESTIMATE OF BENEFITS\n\nIf your dental care will be extensive, ask your dentist to complete and submit a standard WDS or ODS claim form for an estimate. This will allow you to know, in advance exactly what procedures are covered, the amount that will be paid toward the treatment and your financial responsibility.\n\nEXPLANATION OF INCENTIVE PERIODS\n\nYour program is an incentive program designed to provide regular dental care. An incentive period consists of 12 consecutive calendar months. The first incentive period starts with the first day of the month that an eligible person uses dental services and ends on the subsequent June 30th. Thereafter, each incentive period shall consist of the period between July 1 and the subsequent June 30th.\n\nPAYMENT LEVELS FOR CLASS I AND CLASS II BENEFITS\n\nDuring the first incentive period, the payment level for covered and allowable Class I and Class II benefits is 70%. This payment level advances 10 percentage points each successive incentive period in which benefits of this program are used by an eligible person. The payment level increases to a maximum level of 100%. You must visit the dentist at least once during each annual incentive period in order to increase, or maintain, your payment level. If an eligible person fails to utilize benefits in an incentive period, the payment level will be decreased by 10 percentage points for each incentive period for which benefits were not used. This deduction will be made from the last payment level used by the Plan in making payment for the eligible person. In no event will the payment level be less than the starting 70% level.\n\nEach eligible person establishes his or her own payment levels though utilization during incentive periods.\n\nPAYMENT LEVEL FOR CLASS III BENEFITS\n\nThe payment level for covered and allowable Class III benefits is 70%. The incentive provision described above does not apply to Class III Benefits. The payment level for covered dental expenses arising as a direct result of an accidental bodily injury is 100%, up to the unused program maximum.\n\nPROGRAM MAXIMUM\n\nThe maximum amount payable for Class I, Class II and Class III Covered Dental Benefits per eligible person is $1,500 each 12-month period July 1 through June 30. Charges for dental procedures requiring multiple treatment dates shall be considered incurred, and shall be applied to the program maximum, on the date the service is completed.\nThe maximum amount payable for a course of Orthodontic Benefits is $1,250 per each eligible person.\n\nEMPLOYEE ELIGIBILITY AND TERMINATION\n\nEligible employees are all hourly rated employees for whom employer contributions are made.\n\nNew employees are eligible on the first day of the month following completion of six (6) months of employment.\n\nYou must complete an enrollment card. All of your eligible dependents must be listed on the enrollment card.\n\nCoverage terminates at the end of the month in which you cease to be an eligible employee.\n\nDEPENDENT ELIGIBILITY AND TERMINATION\n\nEligible dependents in the program are:\n  \u2022 Your lawful spouse\n  \u2022 Unmarried dependent children, which includes:\n    - natural children\n    - stepchildren\n    - legally adopted children\n\nDependent children are covered from birth to age 19 or to age 23 if attending an accredited school, college or university on a full-time basis. Dependents in the military service are not eligible.\n\nAn unmarried dependent child over the limiting age may continue to be eligible if incapable of self-support because of a physical handicap or developmental disability that commenced prior to reaching the limiting age. The child must have been a covered dependent upon attainment of the limiting age and a physician's certificate must be submitted to the Dental Service Plan within 31 days following attainment of the limiting age.\n\nNewly acquired dependents must be enrolled within 31 days of the month following the date they qualify as an eligible dependent, except newborn infants. Newborns will be covered from the moment of birth.\n\nDependent coverage terminates at the end of the month in which your coverage terminates, or the dependent ceases to be an eligible dependent, whichever occurs first.\n\nCESSATION OF ACTIVE WORK\n\nThe employee's and dependents' dental care coverage will be canceled as of the end of the month an employee is terminated from the payroll of the Company.\nWhen the employee/employer relationship has not been terminated, but the employee is not actively at work, dental care coverage will be subject to the following conditions:\n\nA. Occupational Disability _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of an occupational accident or disease as recognized by the Washington or Oregon Workers' Compensation Board, suffered during the course of his/her employment with the Company, dental care coverage for the employee and any eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company during the period he/she is disabled from work up to a maximum of twenty-four months following the month in which the disability began. If the employee continues to be disabled from work beyond twenty-four months, and the employee/employer relationship is not terminated, these coverages will be canceled unless the employee elects to continue such coverage by paying the premiums.\n\nB. Non-Occupational Disability _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of non-occupational accident or sickness, dental care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company during the period he/she is disabled from work up to a maximum of twelve months following the month in which the disability began. If the employee continues to be disabled beyond twelve months, these coverages will be continued only if the employee elects to continue such coverages with the premium paid for by the employee. Coverage may be continued for up to six months or until the employee/employer relationship is terminated, whichever is the longest.\n\nC. Layoff _ If such employee is absent from work as a result of a layoff due to disciplinary action or lack of work, dental care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company for a period of two months following the month in which the layoff or personal leave of absence began. If the layoff continues beyond two months, coverage can be continued if the employee pays the full monthly cost until the earliest of:\n1. 16 months from the date layoff or personal leave of absence began, or\n2. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or\n3. the date a covered person becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\n4. the date the plan terminates.\n\nD. Personal Leave of Absence (excluding military service) _ If an employee is absent from work as a result of a personal leave of\nabsence requested by the employee and approved by the Company dental care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid by the Company for a period of two months following the month in which the personal leave of absence began. If the personal leave of absence continues beyond two months, this coverage may be continued for up to a maximum of five additional months only if the employee elects to continue such coverage with the premiums paid by the employee and providing the employee-employer relationship is not terminated.\n\nE. Military Service - If such employee is absent from work as a result of participating in a Reserve Training Program of the Armed Forces of the United States, or as a result of serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, dental care coverage for the employee and all eligible dependents will be continued and paid for by the Company for a period of one month following the month in which the absence began. If the absence continues beyond one month following the month in which it began, these coverages will be canceled. For the purpose hereof, the Armed Forces of the United States includes the National Guard of the state in which the employee resides.\n\nF. Death of an Employee\n1. When an employee dies as a result of an industrial accident while actively employed by the Company, OR that employee, at the time of death, is eligible for early retirement, group dental care coverage will continue for the spouse and dependent children who continue to be eligible under the respective plan definitions until either the spouse remarries, is covered by another group dental care program sponsored by another company, or is eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs first. If coverage terminates because the spouse remarries, the spouse will be eligible to continue coverage by self-paying the full monthly cost if:\n   a. he or she is not covered by another group dental care plan, and\n   b. less than 36 months have elapsed since the employee's death.\nIn this event the spouse can self-pay for continued coverage only through the 36th month following the day the employee died.\n\n2. If the employee was not eligible for early retirement and the death was as a result of non-industrial cause, coverage for eligible dependents will continue for six months following the\nmonth in which the death occurs. Coverage can continued for up to an additional 30 months by self-paying the full monthly cost.\n\nEligibility for continued coverage on a self-payment basis will end on the earliest of:\na. the 30-month period indicated above, or\nb. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or\nc. the date a person becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\nd. in the case of a spouse, the date such spouse remarries and becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\ne. the date the plan terminates.\n\nG. Divorce\nIf a spouse loses coverage due to a divorce or legal separation, he or she may continue coverage by paying the full monthly cost until the earliest of:\n1. 36 months from the day which the divorce or legal separation occurred, or\n2. the date the spouse becomes eligible for Medicare, or\n3. the date the spouse becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\n4. the date the spouse remarries and becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\n5. the date the plan terminates.\n\nH. Child Reaches Plan's Maximum Coverage Age\nIf a dependent child loses coverage because he or she has reached the maximum coverage age, the child may continue coverage by paying the full monthly cost until the earliest of:\n1. 36 months from the day the child reached the plan's maximum coverage age, or\n2. the date the child becomes eligible for Medicare, or\n3. the date the child becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\n4. the date the plan terminates.\nI. Strike, Lockout or Other Labor Dispute\n\nAn employee may make payment of premiums directly to Weyerhaeuser Company for a period not exceeding six months, in the event of suspension of compensation because of a lockout, strike or other labor dispute. It is the responsibility of the employer to immediately notify the employees of their right to make payments when their compensation is so suspended or terminated.\n\nJ. Termination\n\nIf an employee loses coverage because his or her employment terminates (other than gross misconduct) or because work hours are reduced, the employee can continue coverage for self and eligible dependents by paying the full monthly cost. Coverage can be continued until the earliest of:\n\n1. 18 months from the day coverage ceased, or\n2. the date a covered person becomes eligible for Medicare, or\n3. the date a person becomes covered under another group dental care plan, or\n4. the date the plan terminates.\n\nSELF-PAYMENT NOTIFICATION PROCESS\n\nIf an employee or eligible dependents loses coverage as a result of death, termination of employment or reduction in hours worked and is eligible to self-pay for continued coverage as explained in the section titled \"Cessation of Active Work,\" Weyerhaeuser Group Insurance Services will notify the employee or dependents of their self-pay options and the plan's monthly costs. The eligible person will then have up to 60 days to decide whether or not to purchase the coverage.\n\nIf a spouse loses coverage due to divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child loses coverage because he or she has reached the maximum coverage age and wants to continue coverage, the employee, spouse or child must notify the local Personnel Department or the Weyerhaeuser Group Insurance Services Manager at the following address within 60 days of the event causing loss of coverage:\n\nGroup Insurance Services Manager\nWeyerhaeuser Company\nTacoma WA 98477\n\nThe spouse or child will then be contacted about the self-pay option and the plan's monthly costs and will have 60 days to decide about purchasing the coverage.\nCOORDINATION OF BENEFITS\n\nIf an eligible person is entitled to benefits under two or more group dental plans, the amount payable under this plan will be coordinated with any other plan. The amount paid by the Plan, together with amounts from other group programs, will not exceed 100% of dental expenses incurred; and the total amount payable by the Plan will not exceed the amount which would have been paid for covered benefits if there were no other program involved. The following rules establish the order of benefit payments:\n\n1. The benefits of the plan that does not have a COB provision will be primary (the plan whose benefits are determined first).\n\n2. The benefits of the plan that covers the person as an active employee will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers the person as a dependent.\n\n3. If the person is a dependent child whose parents are not separated or divorced:\n\nThe benefits of the plan covering the parent whose month and day of birth occurs earlier in the calendar year will be determined before the benefits of the plan of the parent whose month and day of birth occurs later in the calendar year.\n\nHowever, if one of the parent's plan does not have this \"birthday rule,\" then the plan covering the father is primary.\n\n4. If the person is a dependent child of parents who are separated or divorced, then the benefits are determined in the following order:\n\na. The plan of the parent with custody;\n\nb. The plan of the new spouse of the parent with custody;\n\nc. The plan of the parent without custody.\n\nHowever, if the court decrees financial responsibility for the dependent child's dental care, the plan of the parent with the financial responsibility is the primary plan.\n\n5. The plan covering the person as a retired or laid-off employee or dependent of such person will be determined after the benefits of any other plan covering such person as an employee, other than a laid-off or retired employee, or dependent of such person. This provision will not apply if either plan does not have a provision regarding laid-off or retired employees, which results in each plan determining its benefits after the other.\n6. If the above order does not establish the primary plan, then the plan that has covered that person for the longest period of time is the primary plan.\n\nCOVERED DENTAL BENEFITS, LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS\n\nThe following are Class I, Class II and Class III Covered Dental Benefits under this program which are subject to the limitations and exclusions contained in this booklet.

NUMBER\n91-0470860\n\nPLAN NUMBER\n602\nPLAN ADMINISTRATOR\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY, TACOMA, WA 98477\n\nAGENT FOR SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS\nOn the Plan The Plan Administrator or Mr. Alan Vandevert, Secretary,\nWEYERHAEUSER CO., TACOMA, WA 98477\n\nOn the Insurance Company The Supervisory Official of the Insurance Department of the state, district, commonwealth, or territory in which you reside.\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nAll permanent hourly rated employees of the Everett, Cosmopolis, Longview, North Bend, or Springfield branches of the Pulp and Paperboard operations of the Company.\n\nTYPES OF COVERAGES\nDental Expense Benefits\n\nTYPE OF ADMINISTRATION\nThe benefits under the Plan are administered through a contract with Washington Dental Service (WDS), 10700 Meridian Avenue North, Seattle, Washington 98125. This contract provides that claims of covered Oregon employees are administered for WDS by Oregon Dental Service.\n\nPLAN RECORDS FISCAL YEAR\nThe financial records of the Plan are kept on a policy year basis ending on each June 30.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nThe cost of the Plan is paid with contributions by the Plan Sponsor.\n\nSTATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS\nAs a participant in the Weyerhaeuser Company Group Insurance Program, you are entitled to certain rights and protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA provides that all participants shall be entitled to:\n\ni. Examine, without charge at the plan administrator's office and at other locations, such as worksites and union halls, all plan documents, including insurance contracts, collective bargaining agreements and copies of all documents which the plan may have been required to file with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as annual reports and plan descriptions.\n\nii. Obtain copies of all plan documents and other plan information upon written request to the plan administrator. The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.\n\niii. Receive a summary of the plan's annual financial report. If the plan administrator is required to file an annual financial report\nwith the Federal Government, he must furnish each participant with a summary of this financial report.\n\nIn addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit, or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. You have the right to have the plan review and reconsider your claim. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $100 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.\n\nIf you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the plan administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest Area Office of the U.S. Labor-Management Services Administration, Department of Labor.\n\nQUESTIONS REGARDING YOUR PROGRAM\n\nIf you are employed in the state of Washington, direct all questions regarding your dental program to:\n\nClaims Services Department\nWASHINGTON DENTAL SERVICE\nP.O.
