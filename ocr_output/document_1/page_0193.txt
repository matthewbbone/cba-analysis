COORDINATION OF BENEFITS

If an eligible person is entitled to benefits under two or more group dental plans, the amount payable under this plan will be coordinated with any other plan. The amount paid by the Plan, together with amounts from other group programs, will not exceed 100% of dental expenses incurred; and the total amount payable by the Plan will not exceed the amount which would have been paid for covered benefits if there were no other program involved. The following rules establish the order of benefit payments:

1. The benefits of the plan that does not have a COB provision will be primary (the plan whose benefits are determined first).

2. The benefits of the plan that covers the person as an active employee will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers the person as a dependent.

3. If the person is a dependent child whose parents are not separated or divorced:

The benefits of the plan covering the parent whose month and day of birth occurs earlier in the calendar year will be determined before the benefits of the plan of the parent whose month and day of birth occurs later in the calendar year.

However, if one of the parent's plan does not have this "birthday rule," then the plan covering the father is primary.

4. If the person is a dependent child of parents who are separated or divorced, then the benefits are determined in the following order:

a. The plan of the parent with custody;

b. The plan of the new spouse of the parent with custody;

c. The plan of the parent without custody.

However, if the court decrees financial responsibility for the dependent child's dental care, the plan of the parent with the financial responsibility is the primary plan.

5. The plan covering the person as a retired or laid-off employee or dependent of such person will be determined after the benefits of any other plan covering such person as an employee, other than a laid-off or retired employee, or dependent of such person. This provision will not apply if either plan does not have a provision regarding laid-off or retired employees, which results in each plan determining its benefits after the other.
