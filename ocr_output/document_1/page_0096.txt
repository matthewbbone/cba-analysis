If a permanently and totally disabled employee, who is receiving the above described monthly payments, dies before such monthly payments have been exhausted, his/her beneficiary shall be paid the commuted value of the remaining installments in a lump sum plus the above mentioned thirty (30%) percent of his/her Group Term Life Insurance.

When an employee's Group Term Life Coverage is terminated for any cause, his/her life insurance will cease except that if the employee's death should occur within thirty-one (31) days thereafter, the death benefit will be payable. By making application and paying the first premium to the insurance company within thirty-one (31) days following termination of his/her Group Term Life Coverage, the employee may convert his/her Group Term Life Insurance to any individual life insurance policy then customarily issued by the insurance company except term insurance. This individual policy will be issued without medical examination at the insurance company's regular rates.
