top heavy ratio for the permissive aggregation group exceeds 60 percent.

(c) Top heavy ratio: A fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the defined contribution plans for all key employees and the present value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plans for all key employees, and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the defined contribution plans for all Participants and the present value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plans for all Participants. Both the numerator and denominator of the top heavy ratio are adjusted for any distribution of an account balance or an accrued benefit made in the five-year period ending on the determination date and any contribution due but unpaid as of the determination date.

The value of account balance and the present value of accrued benefits will be determined as of the most recent valuation date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the determination date. The account balances and accrued benefits of a Participant who is not a key employee but who was a key employee in a prior year will be disregarded. The calculation of the top heavy ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Section 416 of the Code and the regulation thereunder. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top heavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the determination dates that fall within the same calendar year.

(d) Permissive aggregation group: The required aggregation group of plans plus any other plan or plans of the employer which, when considered as a group with the required aggregation group, would continue to satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

(e) Required aggregation group: (1) Each qualified plan of the employer in which at least one key employee participates, and (2) any other qualified plan of the employer which enables a plan described in (1) to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code.
