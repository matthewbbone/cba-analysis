APPENDIX I - Applicability of Neutrality

a. Gary Attrition Rate Reduction Plan Agreement dated March 18, 1994, and

b. Provisions of the Fairfield Agreements relating to contracting out as determined in the 2003 negotiations.

APPENDIX I—APPLICABILITY OF NEUTRALITY

1. During negotiations the Parties carefully reviewed activities conducted at the existing non-union Ventures of the Company. These discussions established that none of those operations engages in the making of steel or the mining of iron ore. With that importantly in mind, the Parties agree that the Neutrality Section will under no circumstances apply to the current location of an entity which is a Venture of the Company as of March, 29, 2003 (hereinafter "Exempted Entity") provided that after March 29, 2003 (1) the Company does not increase its ownership in, or acquire the right to direct the management and policies of the Exempted Entity such that it becomes an Affiliate, (2) the Exempted Entity does not materially change the nature of its business activities at such location, and (3) the Exempted Entity does not materially expand its facilities.

2. In the event that any of the above conditions are no longer satisfied at an Exempted Entity, then the Neutrality Section shall be immediately fully applicable at such Exempted Entity.
