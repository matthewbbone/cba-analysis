e. CPI Threshold(s) shall be as shown in Paragraph 5 below, based on the formula in Paragraph 6 below.

4. Example:
   Covered Period      10-01-05 – 12-31-05
   Measurement Month    December 2005
   Hypothetical CPI in        202.3
   Measurement Month
   CPI Threshold for the         196.6
   Covered Period The amount,
   of full percentage point(s), by
   which the CPI for the Measurement
   Month exceeds the CPI Threshold
   for the Covered Period

   ((202.3 – 196.6)/196.6) = 2.0%

   Earnings in Covered Period      $12,000
   IRP Payment ($12,000 x 2.0%) = $240.00
