APPENDIX B—CONTRACTING OUT AGREEMENTS

APPENDIX B-1: INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTING OUT LANGUAGE

1. During the negotiation of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement, the Parties recognized that certain language changes could mistakenly be interpreted to connote a substantive change where none was intended.

2. The Parties hereby expressly agree that the capability standard described in Article Two, Section (F)(1)(a), as well as the headings of Article Two, Sections F(2)(a) and 2(b), are to be interpreted as having the same meanings as those determined by the Board of Arbitration pursuant to the counterpart language set forth in the 1999 Basic Labor Agreement.

APPENDIX B-2: NON-CORE WORK

1. The Parties have agreed that the non-core work of janitorial, grounds keeping, and road maintenance services may be contracted out as the number of current incumbents performing such work is reduced by attrition and provided that there are no Employees on layoff at the Plant. Attrition is defined as any permanent move of a current incumbent from such job, including promotion or transfer to another job, as well as leaving the workforce.

2. Work contracted out pursuant to this agreement shall not be subject to the provisions of Article Two, Section F(3), ("Commitment") of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement.
