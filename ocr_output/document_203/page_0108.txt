2. This will confirm our understanding that, in order to balance and accommodate the concerns referenced above, no Local Union officer eligible to bid for a promotion shall be denied a job award and incumbency status on the position sought solely because of that Employee's unavailability for work due to the duties attendant their Local Union position. However, where a Local Union officer is awarded a job and becomes incumbent to a position that otherwise would have been denied to him because of unavailability due to his Local Union position, the Company, at its discretion, may decide to withhold assigning such Employee to that position until such time as he is available to perform the job as required. Instead, during any period of unavailability, the Company may assign another Employee, who can meet the job's attendance requirements, to work the position. When a Local Union officer is working below his incumbency status solely because of such Company action he shall receive a special allowance reflecting any difference in wages between what the Local Union officer earned while at work on the lower position and what the Employee, assigned by the Company to work on his incumbent position, was paid on turns when the Local Union officer was working on the lower position.

3. This understanding supersedes prior inconsistent arbitration awards. It will apply to permanent vacancies awarded on or after the effective date of this Agreement.
