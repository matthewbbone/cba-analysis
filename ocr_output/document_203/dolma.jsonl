The Chair of the Union Negotiating Committee, the District Director and the International Representative shall have access to the Plant at reasonable times to investigate issues involving grievances with which they are concerned.\n\np. In the event a grievance is sustained or granted at arbitration, the Company will pay for all lost time for the grievant and the designated Union representative for participation in Steps 1, 2 and 3 of the grievance procedure in accordance with local Plant understandings.\n\n5.

The hearings shall be scheduled as required at each location, as close to the Plant site as is reasonable. 5.H.58\nc. On each hearing date the Parties shall, subject to the time available, attempt to present all cases scheduled for arbitration. The cases, unless agreed otherwise, shall be scheduled in the order in which they were appealed, provided that all pending discharge cases shall be scheduled first, and provided further that either Party may seek agreement from the other to have a case scheduled out of order for good cause, such request not to be unreasonably denied.\n\nd. Failure to present a case at a scheduled hearing shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance and failure to respond to a case when presented shall constitute granting of the grievance and agreement to the remedy sought, provided that a hearing may be postponed once if the Board determines that circumstances clearly require postponement. However, the Parties may agree to postpone a grievance scheduled for arbitration.\n\n8. Rules for Hearings\n\na. The Parties agree that the prompt resolution of cases brought to arbitration is of the highest importance.

Suspension and Discharge Procedure\n\n(1) An Employee shall not be peremptorily discharged. In all cases in which the Company may conclude that an Employee's conduct may justify suspension or discharge, he shall be suspended initially for not more than five (5) calendar days.\n\n(2) Before imposing a suspension or discharge, the Company shall give written notice of the suspension or suspension subject to discharge to the affected Employee. A copy of the discharge or suspension notice shall be promptly furnished to such Employee's Grievance Committeeman.\n(3) The affected Employee may request in writing and shall be granted a preliminary hearing within five (5) days of the issuance of the notice of suspension.

The Company will not make use of any personnel records of previous disciplinary action against the Employee involved where the disciplinary action occurred three (3) or more years prior to the date of the event which is the subject of suspension or discharge.\n\ne. Should the Board determine that an Employee has been suspended or discharged without proper cause, the Board shall have the authority to modify the discipline and fashion a remedy warranted by the facts.\n\nf. Nothing in these provisions shall restrict or expand the Company's right to relieve an Employee for the balance of such Employee's shift under the terms of the Agreement.\n\n10.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following mini-arbitration procedure is designed to provide prompt and efficient handling of grievances concerning written reprimands or sus-\npensions of five (5) days or less, excluding discipline for concerted activity.\n\nb. The mini-arbitration procedure shall be implemented in light of the circumstances existing in each Plant, with due regard to the following:\n\n(1) The International Representative of the Union designated pursuant to the Basic Labor Agreement may appeal a grievance by written notice served simultaneously on the Administrative Secretary of the area panel and the Company's Step 3 Representative within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the Company Step 3 Answer. If the grievance is not so appealed to the mini-arbitration procedure, it shall be considered withdrawn.\n\n(2) Hearings shall be held one (1) day per calendar month, provided at least three (3) grievances have been appealed to mini-arbitration. The Administrative Secretary of the area panel shall schedule the hearing at a date, time and place, mutually agreed to by the Parties.

In all respects, he shall assure that the hearing is a fair one.\n\n(6) If the arbitrator or the Parties conclude at the hearing that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to require further consideration by the Parties, the case shall be referred back to the Step 3 and it shall be processed as though appealed on such date.\n\nd. The arbitrator shall issue a decision no later than forty-eight (48) hours after conclusion of the hearing (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays). His decision shall be based on the records developed by the Parties before and at the hearing and shall include a brief written explanation of the basis for his conclusion. These decisions shall not be cited as a precedent in any discussion or at any step of the grievance or arbitration procedure. Should it be determined by the arbitrator that an Employee has been suspended for proper cause, the arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to modify the degree of discipline imposed by the Company.\ne. Any grievance appealed to this mini-arbitration procedure must be confined to issues which do not involve novel problems and which have limited contractual significance or complexity. If the Union appeals a grievance to the Board of Arbitration under circumstances where it is clear from the issue embodied in the grievance that jurisdiction to resolve the grievance lies solely within the min-arbitration procedure and should the Board conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over the grievance, the Union, after such award, may not thereafter appeal such grievance to mini-arbitration; provided, however, that if it is unclear from the issue embodied in such grievance whether jurisdiction to resolve the grievance lies solely within the mini-arbitration procedure, but the Board concludes that it lacks jurisdiction, the Union may appeal such grievance to mini-arbitration within ten (10) days of the date of such award.\n\nSection I.

The Employee must file with his/her home Plant, on a form provided by the Company, a written request for such transfer specifying the other Plant or Plants at which s/he would accept employment.\n\nb. Employees who apply shall be given priority for permanent vacancies at other Plants which are not filled from within the particular Plant in the order of their Continuous Service (the earlier date of birth to control where such service is identical), provided the Employee has the necessary qualifications to perform the job and advance in the promotional sequence. In determining qualifications, the Employee shall be treated as if the job were an opening at his/her home Plant.\nc. An Employee laid off from his/her Plant who is offered and accepts a job at another Plant, will have the same obligation to report for work there as though s/he were a laid-off Employee at that Plant. During his/her employment at that Plant, s/he will be subject to all the rules and conditions of employment in effect at that Plant. S/he will be considered as a new Employee at that Plant and therefore such Employee's Plant Service shall be defined in accordance with Article Five, Section E(3)(c).\n\nd. An Employee shall be deemed to reject such job if s/he does not affirmatively respond within five (5) days of the time the offer is made, which offer shall be directed to his/her last place of residence as shown on the written request referred to in Paragraph (a) above. If an Employee rejects such job pursuant to this provision, his/her name shall be removed from those eligible for priority hereunder, and he/she may apply, pursuant to Section D(1)(a), for reinstatement.\n\ne. An Employee who accepts employment at another Plant under this Section will continue to accrue Plant Service for seniority purposes at his/her home Plant in accordance with the applicable seniority rules for a maximum period of six (6) months from the date of transfer. If within the six (6) month period, s/he is recalled to work at his/her home Plant and s/he elects to return, his/her Continuous Service for seniority pur-\nposes at the other Plant will be cancelled. If s/he elects to remain at the other Plant, his/her Continuous Service for seniority purposes at his/her home Plant will be cancelled.\n\nf. When an Employee is recalled to his/her home Plant, the Company may require the Employee to remain at such other Plant for the calendar week following the calendar week during which such recall occurs.\n\n2. An Employee who accepts a job at another Plant, pursuant to this section, more than 100 miles from his/her home Plant will receive a relocation allowance of $500 promptly after the commencement of employment at the Plant to which s/he is relocated.\n\nARTICLE NINE \u2013 ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY\n\nSection A.

This provision shall not affect the rights of any Employee or the Company under another provision of this Agreement.\n\nSection B. Salary Differential (Red Circle)\n\nShould a USS or former National Steel Employee's incumbent standard biweekly salary rate under the August 1, 1999 Basic Labor Agreement (the 1999 Salary Rate) be higher than the established Salary Rate of Pay for the\nnew position box to which his/her former incumbent job was slotted during workplace restructuring, a salary differential (Red Circle) shall be determined for each Employee and added to all hours paid whether or not such hours are worked.\n\n2. Such red-circle adjustment shall cease to apply upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\n\na. the Salary Rate of Pay of the Employee's new job meets or exceeds his/her 1999 Salary Rate, or\n\nb. the Employee moves from the job into which he/she was originally slotted as a result of promotion, demotion, or for any other reason.\n\nSection C.

Seven and one half percent (7.5%) of all Profits between $10 and $50 of Profit per Ton Shipped;\n\nb. Ten percent (10.0%) of all Profits above $50 of Profit per Ton Shipped.\n\n3. Calculation of Profits\n\na. Profit shall be defined as Income from Operations of the Company, calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with the following exclusions:\n(1) Income or loss related to any charges or credits (whether or not identified as special credits or charges) for unusual, infrequently occurring or extraordinary items, including credits or charges for Plant closures, business dispositions and asset sales that are not normal operating charges or credits of the Company;\n\n(2) Any cost or expense associated with the Benefit Trust;\n\n(3) Any cost or expense associated with the Profit Offset;\n\n(4) Any cost or expense associated with the Profit Sharing Plan; and\n\n(5) Any payments, fees or other expenses that are not in the normal course of business paid directly or indirectly to any person or entity who directly or indirectly owns or controls any equity or equity-like interest in the Company.\n\nb. Calculation Sequence\n\nProfit as determined in Paragraph 3 (a) above will be used to calculate the amount of the contribution to the Benefit Trust as provided in Section C(1)(b) of the Benefit Trust found in Appendix BB of the 2003 Settlement Agreement. Profit after deducting the amount of the contribution to the Benefit Trust will then be used to calculate the amount of the Profit Offset as provided in the Program of Hospital-Medical Benefits. Profit after deducting the amount of the\ncontribution to the Benefit Trust and the amount of the Profit Offset will then be used to calculate the Pool available for Profit Sharing as provided in Article Nine, Section E.\n\nc. Tons Shipped shall be defined as tons of steel products shipped by the Company on a consolidated basis to third parties.\n\n4. Individual Entitlement\n\nThe Pool will be divided among all Employees (Participants) on the basis of the Hours (as defined below) of each such Participant in the calendar weeks within each fiscal quarter.\n\na. Hours shall include the following, but shall not exceed forty (40) hours for any week for any Participant: hours worked (including straight time and overtime hours), vacation and holiday hours at the rate of eight (8) hours for each holiday or day of vacation; hours on Union business; and hours, at the rate of eight (8) hours a day, while receiving Workers' Compensation benefits (based on the number of days absent from work while receiving such benefits).\n\nb. Any payments made to a Participant pursuant to this Plan shall not be included in the Participant's earnings for purposes of determining any other pay, benefit or allowance of the Participant.\n\n5. Administration of the Plan\n\na. The Plan will be administered by the Company in accordance with its terms and the costs of administration shall be the responsibility of the\nCompany. Upon determination of each Quarterly Profit calculation, such calculation shall be forwarded to the Chair of the Union Negotiating Committee accompanied by a Certificate of Officer signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, providing a detailed description of any adjustments made to Income from Operations and stating that Profit was determined in accordance with GAAP and that Quarterly Profit was calculated in accordance with this Section.\n\nb. The Union, through the Chair of its Negotiating Committee or his/her designee, shall have the right to review and audit any information, calculation or other matters concerning the Plan. The Company shall provide the Union with any information reasonably requested in connection with its review and the Union and any outside consultants that it uses shall not disclose any portion of such information that is confidential. The reasonable actual costs incurred by the Union in connection with any such audit shall be paid from the Pool and deducted from the amount otherwise available under the Pool for distribution to Employees.\n\nc. In the event that a discrepancy exists between the Company's Profit Sharing calculation and the results obtained by the Union's review, the Chairs of the Union and Company Negotiating Committees shall attempt to reach an agreement\nregarding the discrepancy. In the event that they cannot resolve the dispute, either Party may submit such dispute to final and binding arbitration under the grievance procedure provided in this Agreement.\n\n6. Prompt Payment\n\nNotwithstanding Paragraph 5, the Company shall comply with the requirements of Paragraphs 2 through 4 based on its interpretation of the appropriate payout. If the process described in Paragraph 5 results in a requirement for an additional payout, said payout shall be made no more than fourteen (14) days after the date of the agreed upon resolution or issuance of the arbitrator's decision.\n\n7. Summary Description\n\nThe Parties will jointly develop a description of the calculations used to derive profit sharing payments under the Plan for each quarter and distribute it to each Participant.\n\nSection G. Inflation Recognition Payment\n\n1. General Description\n\nThe below general description is qualified in its entirety by Paragraphs 2 through 6 below.\n\nThe purpose of the Inflation Recognition Payment (IRP) is to make quarterly lump-sum payments to Employees if cumulative inflation, as measured over the life of the Basic Labor Agreement, exceeds three percent (3%) per year.\n\nAt the end of each calendar quarter, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the final\nmonth of that quarter will be compared to a CPI Threshold (as found in the Table in Paragraph 5 below) which represents what the CPI would be if total inflation since the beginning of the Agreement had averaged three percent (3%) per year. If the actual CPI is higher than the CPI Threshold, a lump sum payment shall be made equal to each full one percent (1.0%) by which the actual CPI is higher than the CPI Threshold, multiplied by the hourly equivalent Salary Rate of Pay for each position worked by an Employee for all hours actually worked and overtime allowance (hereafter referred to as \"earnings\") for the quarter.\n\nThus, if in a given quarter three percent (3%) annual inflation since the beginning of the Agreement would have produced total inflation of ten percent (10%) and the actual CPI indicates that inflation since the beginning of the contract has been twelve percent (12%) and an Employee had earnings as defined in the paragraph above during the quarter of $12,000, then that Employee would receive a lump-sum payment of two percent (2%) (12% actual inflation minus a 10% CPI Threshold) times $12,000 or $240.\n\n2. IRP Payments\n\na. Beginning the first full calendar quarter after January 1, 2004, the Company shall, on each Payment Date, make to each Employee an IRP payment equal to:\n\n(1) their total earnings as defined above for the Covered Period, multiplied by\n\n(2) each full percentage (1.0%), by which the CPI for the\nARTICLE 9. Section G - Inflation Recognition Payment (Contd.)\n\nMeasurement Month exceeds the CPI Threshold for the Measurement Month.\n\nb. No IRP will be made for any Covered Period unless the CPI for the Measurement Month is greater than the CPI Threshold; in the event the CPI is lower than the CPI Threshold there shall be no recoupment of any kind.\n\nThe IRP shall be a lump-sum payment and shall not be part of the Employee's Salary Rate of Pay or used in the calculation of any other pay, allowance or benefit.\n\n3. Definitions\n\na. CPI shall mean the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), U.S. City Average, All Items, Not Seasonally Adjusted (1982-84=100) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the Consumer Price Index in its present form and on the same basis as the last Index published prior to January 1, 2004 becomes unavailable, this Section shall be adjusted to produce as nearly as possible the same result as would have been achieved using the Index in its present form.\n\nb. Payment Date shall be the forty-fifth (45th) day after the last day of the Measurement Month.\n\nc. Measurement Month shall be the last month of a Covered Period.\n\nd. Covered Period(s) shall be as shown in Paragraph 5 below.\ne. CPI Threshold(s) shall be as shown in Paragraph 5 below, based on the formula in Paragraph 6 below.\n\n4. Example:\n   Covered Period      10-01-05 \u2013 12-31-05\n   Measurement Month    December 2005\n   Hypothetical CPI in        202.3\n   Measurement Month\n   CPI Threshold for the         196.6\n   Covered Period The amount,\n   of full percentage point(s), by\n   which the CPI for the Measurement\n   Month exceeds the CPI Threshold\n   for the Covered Period\n\n   ((202.3 \u2013 196.6)/196.6) = 2.0%\n\n   Earnings in Covered Period      $12,000\n   IRP Payment ($12,000 x 2.0%) = $240.00\n5.

Military Encampment Allowance\n\nAn Employee who is required to attend an encampment of the Reserve of the Armed Forces or the National Guard shall be paid, for a period not to exceed two (2) weeks in any one (1) calendar year, the difference between the amount paid by the government (not including travel, subsistence and quarters allowance) and his/her applicable Salary Rate of Pay plus any applicable salary differential (Red Circle) for the number of days s/he would have been scheduled to work during such encampment.\n\nSection G. Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nThe Company shall comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and further agrees to the following regarding employee eligibility and entitlement.

A copy of a summary of the law and Employee rights thereunder is available at the Company's Personnel Services Office for review and will be issued upon request and at the time any FMLA leave is requested. The required posting under the FMLA will be maintained by the Company.\n\n2. Eligibility and Entitlement\n\na. Leave under this Section shall be available to any Employee who has twelve (12) months or more of Continuous Service calculated pursuant to the Seniority provisions of\nthis Agreement. There shall be no hours-worked requirement for eligibility.\n\nb. Any eligible Employee shall be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave for FMLA eligible reasons in any twelve (12) month period. This period shall be measured on a rolling twelve (12) month basis, measured backward from the date any FMLA leave is used. Any time taken off in connection with any of the situations covered by the FMLA shall be counted toward the twelve (12) week period, except as otherwise excluded.\n\n3. Pay During FMLA Leave\n\na. Employees seeking FMLA leave under this Section may be required to utilize up to one (1) week of unused paid vacation.\n\nb. An Employee may request to utilize additional paid vacation during the FMLA leave time. The Company reserves the right to approve such a request where it involves a change in the vacation schedule.\n\nc. Except for the substitution of paid vacation and the utilization of Sickness and Accident, or Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits, all time off provided shall be unpaid and shall be considered as time not worked for all other matters.\n\nd. An Employee on FMLA leave is not eligible for Supplemental Unemployment Benefits in the event of a layoff, until following the termination of the leave.\n4. Continuous Service\n\nLeaves of absence under this Section shall not constitute a break in Continuous Service and the period of such leave shall be included in an Employee's length of Continuous Service under this Agreement and all benefit agreements.\n\n5. Benefit Continuation\n\na. All Employees' benefit coverage will continue during such leave, provided the Employee is otherwise eligible for such coverage under provisions of the FMLA or this Section and the Employee continues making any normally-required premium or other payments in a manner acceptable to the Company. In the event the Employee fails to make such payments, all benefit coverage shall terminate.\n\nb. In the event an Employee fails to return to work or quits after the Employee's FMLA leave period has been concluded, the Company waives its right to recover the cost of health insurance coverage provided by the Company during such leave.\n\nSection H. Sick Leave\n\n1. The provisions of this Article shall cover Employees absent from work as the result of personal disability caused by accident or sickness and shall be in lieu of all prior practices and policies pertaining to salary continuance during such absence.\n\n2. Allowances\n\na. Salary shall be continued during disability as defined in Paragraph 1 of\nthis Section at the Employee's applicable biweekly Salary Rate of Pay plus any applicable salary differential (Red Circle) in accordance with Paragraph 4 (Table of Limitations).\n\nb. Salary continuance in accordance with the Table of Limitations shall constitute the maximum payments under this Agreement for an Employee's absences from work due to one or more personal disabilities in any 12-month period; provided, however, that fractional initial pay periods for each disability for which salary is continued shall not be counted in the maximum salary continuance in a 12-month period, any succeeding maximum period shall not commence until another disability following his return to work.\n\nc. Salary continuance payments shall be reduced by the amount of any Worker's Compensation payments that may be payable to an Employee with respect to the period of salary continuance.\n\nd. The maximum salary continuance payment for any pay period shall not exceed an Employee's applicable biweekly Salary Rate of Pay plus any applicable salary differential (Red Circle) nor shall any Employee be paid salary continuance in excess of that amount he would have earned at his applicable biweekly Salary Rate of Pay had he not been absent from work due to personal disability. Such salary continuance payment shall not be reduced or discontinued as the result of any demotion or reduction in force which occurs during the\napplicable period set forth in the Table of Limitations so long as the Employee remains disabled as defined in Section 1 during such period.\n\ne. Salary continuance shall not be paid during any period while an Employee is on paid vacation.\n\n3. To be eligible for payments under the provisions of this Article, an Employee shall have accrued two years of BLA continuous service prior to the commencement of the biweekly pay period. Reasonable evidence (including, in appropriate circumstances, a certificate from a licensed physician) of disability due to sickness or accident will be required of all Employees regardless of date of hire.\n\n4.

Board of Directors\n\n1. The Company and the Union acknowledge that every member of the Company's Board of Directors (Board, members of such Board, Directors) has a fiduciary duty to the Company and all of its stockholders.\n\n2. The Company's Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Principles,\nwhich specify criteria used in selecting candidates for the Board. Such criteria have been made known to the Union.\n\n3. The Company agrees that the Union shall have the right, subject to the procedures described below and the Directors' discharge of their fiduciary duties, to designate two (2) individuals for consideration to serve on the Board.\n\na. The International President shall provide the Board's Chairman with the names and resumes of the individuals whom s/he wishes to have serve on the Board.\n\nb. Provided that the individuals are acceptable to the Chairman (it being understood that in all respects each individual will be dealt with separately), such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, the Chairman shall promptly recommend such individual(s) to the Board's Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee, who absent compelling reasons to the contrary, shall promptly recommend such individual(s) to the full Board for election at its next meeting.\n\nc. Once elected, the individual(s) shall be recommended by the Board for election by the shareholders to serve a regular term at the Company's next Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n4. If after election, the individual(s) becomes unwilling or unable to serve or the Union wishes to replace one or both of them, the International President shall inform the individual(s) and the Board's Chairman and provide the Board's Chairman with the name of a new\nindividual(s) whom s/he wishes to have serve on the Board and the process outlined above shall thereafter be followed. In such case the individual(s) previously named by the International President shall be deemed to have undergone a significant change in their business or professional careers and in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, such individual shall volunteer to resign from the Board. If such resignation is not accepted, the individual(s) shall no longer be considered to have been designated by the Union.\n\n5. At the time that any person is nominated by the Union as provided in this Section A, said nominee shall acknowledge in whatever fashion such acknowledgement is given by all of the Company's other Directors, that such nominee, if elected to the Board, would have a fiduciary duty to the Company and its stockholders.\n\nSection B. Investment Commitment\n\n1. The Company agrees to make the reasonable and necessary capital expenditures required to maintain the competitive status of the facilities covered by this Agreement.\n\n2. The Union agrees to contribute to the competitiveness of the facilities and work with the Company to maintain the competitive nature of the facilities.\n\n3. The Company agrees that no Plant covered by this Agreement will operate its facilities at other than full capacity, except during maintenance and repair outages, and directly or indirectly replace\nthe product which could have been produced on such facilities with product obtained from other than Canadian or United States facilities that provide base wages, benefits and protections such as just cause and seniority that are substantially equivalent to those provided in this Agreement.\n\n4. The Company shall make all capital expenditures required to maintain the competitiveness and capacity of facilities within the Plants covered by this Agreement, including investments that increase competitiveness and productivity, unless:\n\na. such facilities have been shut down pursuant to provisions of this Agreement; or\n\nb. the Company has conducted full and extensive consultation with the Union and fully and carefully considered all Union input concerning the subject Capital Expenditure; and\n\nc. making the subject Capital Expenditure would be imprudent.\n\nWith regard to any determination by the Board to not make any Capital Expenditures, it shall be presumed that:\n\n(1) said determination was made correctly; and\n\n(2) making the subject Capital Expenditures would be imprudent for the Company.\n\n5. The Company further agrees that it will not purchase, trade, sell or use, within the United States or Canada, coke or iron ore mined, refined and/or manufactured\noutside of the United States or Canada (Imported coke or iron ore) in any given calendar year covered by this Agreement, unless the ratio of the difference between the amount of any Imported coke or iron ore, respectively and the Company's sales of coke or iron ore to third parties then divided by the consumption of coke or iron ore at the facilities covered by this Agreement is no more than .10 in that year.\n\n6. The Company agrees to carefully consider further acquisitions of steel and steel related companies and/or assets suggested by the USWA, including growth opportunities in the area of the value-added manufacturing of steel products.\n\n7. The Company will not pursue any transaction involving steel or steel-related assets in North America without the approval of the USWA.\n\nSection C. Upstreaming\n\n1. The Company agrees that it will only Upstream in an amount consistent with: the Company's historical, current and projected financial performance and capital spending requirements; the terms of any preferred stock sold for full and fair value and paying a market rate dividend (at the time of issuance); and the maintenance of a reasonable financial position.\n\n2. Without in any way limiting the applicability of Paragraph 1 above, the Company agrees that all transactions (including, without limitation, sales, loans, purchases, leases, guarantees, fees of any kind, and equity transactions)\nbetween the Company and any equity holder or any Affiliate of any equity holder, shall be conducted on an arm's-length basis, on commercially reasonable terms not less favorable to the Company than those that could be obtained from an unrelated third party, and in accordance with any shareholders agreement of the Company. In addition, any loan or similar transaction to any such person shall only be made if it is beneficial to the Company and on terms consistent with the business relationship between such person and the Company. Subject to the foregoing, the Company may engage in transactions with its equity holders and their Affiliates.\n\n3. For the purposes of this Section, Upstreaming includes directly or indirectly, paying any dividends on, or making any distributions, exchanges, conversions, retirements, repurchases or redemptions, in respect of the Company's stock.\n\nSection D. Right to Bid\n\n1. Should the Company decide or be presented with a bona fide offer to sell or otherwise transfer a controlling interest in the corporate entity which owns one or more of its facilities covered by this Agreement, (a Controlling Interest) or all or a portion of one or more of its facilities covered by this Agreement (Facilities) (either or both, the Assets), it will promptly advise the USWA in writing and grant to the USWA the right to organize a transaction to purchase the Assets (a Transaction).\n2. The Company will provide the USWA with any information provided to other bidders so that the Union may determine whether it wishes to pursue a Transaction. All such information shall be subject to an executed Confidentiality Agreement.\n\n3. The Company shall promptly notify the USWA of the schedule and/or timetable for consideration by the Company of any possible transaction. The Company will provide the USWA with the greater of (a) forty-five (45) days or (b) the time provided by the schedule and/or timetable given to other interested parties to submit an offer for the Assets, except in the case of an unsolicited offer for a controlling interest in the Company in which case the USWA shall be provided with the time provided by the schedule and/or timetable given to other interested parties.\n\n4. During the period described in Paragraph 3 above, the Company will not enter into any contract regarding the Assets with another party.\n\n5. In the event that the USWA submits an offer pursuant to the above, the Company shall not be under any obligation to accept such offer. However, the Company may not enter into an agreement with regard to the Assets with an entity other than the USWA unless that transaction is superior to the USWA offer. The Company may only deem a proposed transaction superior if its Board of Directors reasonably determines that such transaction is more favorable to the Company and/or its shareholders, taking into consideration\nsuch factors as price, form of consideration, certainty of payment, conditions precedent to closing, competitive factors, and other factors which influence which of the transactions is in the best interests of the Company and/or its shareholders.\n\n6. This Section shall not cover any public offering of equity or the transfer of any assets between the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 11.D.6\n\n7. The rights granted to the USWA in this Section may be transferred or assigned by the USWA but only on a Transaction specific basis and provided further, that:\n\na. in the event the person or entity to whom such right is transferred or assigned is a competitor of the Company, then the Company may reasonably manage the provision of confidential information to said entity; 11.D.8\n\nb. the Union and such person or entity have entered into an agreement satisfying the successorship provisions of Article Two, Section D of this Agreement; and 11.D.9\n\nc. in the event of a transaction that does not involve a Controlling Interest and where the Company decides to only pursue, for legitimate business reasons, a transaction which will result in a sale of less than 100% of the Company's interest in the Assets, the USWA's transferee or assignee must be reasonably acceptable to the Company. 11.D.10\nSection E. Lean Management\n\nThe Company agrees to minimize the ratio of non-bargaining unit employees at the facilities covered by the Agreement, including full-time or full-time equivalent contractors of any sort performing services historically performed by the Company's non-bargaining unit employees and other employees of the Company who work at other locations but whose work is associated with, related to or supports the activities at the facilities (Non-Bargaining Unit employees), to bargaining unit Employees and shall take all reasonable actions (including transferring responsibilities and duties to bargaining unit Employees) with the objective of achieving a ratio of no more than one (1) Non-Bargaining Unit employee for each five (5) bargaining unit Employees, with an absolute commitment to a ratio of no more than one (1) Non-Bargaining Unit employee for each four (4) bargaining unit Employees.\n\nSection F. General Provisions\n\n1. In the event of any disputes under this Article Eleven the International President of the Union and the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or their designees shall meet and in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n2. If they are unable to do so, they may agree upon an arbitration or other mechanism to resolve the dispute. If such alternative arrangements are not agreed to, either Party may proceed to file a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such court and waives any and all objections they may have concerning venue or similar issue.\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION\n\nJ. D.

During the negotiation of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement, the Parties recognized that certain language changes could mistakenly be interpreted to connote a substantive change where none was intended.\n\n2. The Parties hereby expressly agree that the capability standard described in Article Two, Section (F)(1)(a), as well as the headings of Article Two, Sections F(2)(a) and 2(b), are to be interpreted as having the same meanings as those determined by the Board of Arbitration pursuant to the counterpart language set forth in the 1999 Basic Labor Agreement.\n\nAPPENDIX B-2: NON-CORE WORK\n\n1. The Parties have agreed that the non-core work of janitorial, grounds keeping, and road maintenance services may be contracted out as the number of current incumbents performing such work is reduced by attrition and provided that there are no Employees on layoff at the Plant. Attrition is defined as any permanent move of a current incumbent from such job, including promotion or transfer to another job, as well as leaving the workforce.\n\n2. Work contracted out pursuant to this agreement shall not be subject to the provisions of Article Two, Section F(3), (\"Commitment\") of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement.\nAPPENDIX B-3\u2014TRANSITION WORK AT NATIONAL FACILITIES\n\n1. As a result of the need to transition the former National facilities to USS systems and business practices, a certain amount of work may need to be contracted out. Accordingly, the Parties mutually agree that the following work may be contracted out at the former National facilities for a period of six months following the Effective Date of the 2003 Combined Company Basic Labor Agreement:\n\na. Installation/modification/upgrade of plant and gate/access control systems including TIMES system.\n\nb. Installation/modification of plant security systems.\n\nc. Installation/modification/upgrade of computer hardware, software, networks, and systems infrastructure including phone and communications systems.\n\nd. Facilities infrastructure assessment, including engineering inspections.\n\n2. If, after the expiration of the six-month period, the Company believes it is necessary to extend the period, the Chairs of the Company and Union Negotiating Committees shall discuss the need and resolve the matter.\n\nAPPENDIX B-4: FAIRFIELD WORKS CONTRACTING OUT AGREEMENT\n\nThe Parties reached certain understandings during negotiations for the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement regarding the use of contractors to perform certain full-time work inside the Plant at Fairfield Works. It is agreed\nthat the Company may no longer rely on provisions in the December 24, 1983 Fairfield Works Agreement to have contractors perform full-time maintenance and repair work inside the Plant. Accordingly, the Parties have agreed to the following process to displace said contractor employees:\n\n1. The Company will use its best efforts to add a total of twenty (20) Employees to the Bull Gangs (Maintenance Technicians, Labor Grade 4) within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement. The twenty (20) may be comprised of internal bidders from across Fairfield Works, IJOP transfers or new hires, including individuals currently performing work at Fairfield for a contractor.\n\n2. Promptly following the Effective Date, the Company will post a notice at its other Plants advising IJOP-eligible Employees of potential Maintenance Technician opportunities at Fairfield Works.\n\n3. Promptly following the Effective Date, the Company will inform the employees of Fairfield Southern by way of an appropriate posting of Maintenance Technician opportunities for qualified candidates at Fairfield Works. Qualified employees of Fairfield Southern will be considered before other non-Employees.\n\n4. Promptly following the Effective Date, the Company will solicit interest from among current contractor employees for Maintenance Technician opportunities at Fairfield.\n\n5. Promptly following the Effective Date, appropriate Company representatives will meet with Contract Coordinator Mullins to discuss implementation of a Maintenance Technician learner/trainee\nprogram. Unless otherwise agreed, the Company shall implement a program based upon the Clairton Works program for Mechanical and Electrical Repairmen. The program established for Fairfield shall conform to the provisions of Appendix A-3 of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement. The trainee/learner program shall be designed to produce a fully qualified Maintenance Technician.\n\n6. During the sixty (60) days following the Effective Date, the local parties shall jointly review contractor utilization inside Fairfield. The purpose of this review shall be to identify the amount of full-time maintenance and repair work being done by contractors and to determine the number of Employees that need to be added to the Bull Gangs to absorb such work. For the Union, this effort will be led by Coordinator Mullins, who may be assisted by a representative from each of the affected Local Unions appointed by the Local Union Presidents. The Parties agree that limited scope maintenance personnel need to become qualified Maintenance Technicians, and shall be provided with the opportunity for training to make that possible. It is understood that the Company shall not be required to hire or train Employees to be limited scope maintenance personnel such as Carpenters. It is agreed that the shops other than the Line Crew Shop and Electronic Shop may continue to be phased out through attrition. During the phase out of these shops, it is agreed that work in the category of each of these shops that is not capable of being performed by the Bull Gangs may be contracted out, provided that the Employees remaining in those shops\npost-TAP are offered forty (40) hours of work per week plus reasonable overtime opportunity.\n\n7. Displacement of such full-time contractors shall be accomplished through a combination of assignment of such work to existing Employees, hiring and the trainee/learner program. Contractor employees performing this full-time work will be displaced as quickly as possible, consistent with the need for stable operations.\n\n8. The Bull Gangs may be assigned throughout Fairfield Works without restriction, so long as they are not assigned to a department on a full-time basis to replace qualified maintenance Employees who are laid off.\n\n9. Employees must achieve a passing score on the test utilized to determine ability to perform the work of a Maintenance Technician at the standard rate in order to qualify for the Labor Grade 4 rate of pay.\n\n10. The local parties shall be required to provide periodic reports, as requested by the Chair of the respective Negotiating Committees, concerning the training and hiring of Maintenance Technicians at Fairfield and the progress toward displacing the contractor employees as described above.\n\n11. In addition to the above, the Company agrees to cease using contractor employees for crane lubrication work.\n\n12. If the local parties cannot agree on matters involving the implementation of this agreement, the dispute will be referred to the Chairs of the Negotiating\nCommittees. If the Chairs are unable to resolve the matter, it may be appealed by the Union to the Board of Arbitration. The Board shall decide the matter based on the terms set forth in this agreement.\n\n13. Notwithstanding Article Two, Section F(6)(a), other than as modified by this agreement, agreements permitting contracting out in effect at Fairfield prior to the Effective Date of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement shall remain in effect. Compliance with this agreement fully satisfies the provisions of Article Two, Section F(3) of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement.\n\n14. The use of contractor employees to perform the full-time work covered by this agreement may continue only until such employees are phased out and replaced by Bull Gang Employees, which must be done as quickly as practical.\n\nAPPENDIX C\u2014RESTRUCTURING\n\nAPPENDIX C-1: WORKPLACE RESTRUCTURING AND PRODUCTIVITY\n\n1. The Parties recognize that employment security and productivity improvement must be inseparably linked if the Company is to attain sustained profitability. During the course of the negotiations leading to the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement, the Parties agreed to workplace restructuring. The objective of this restructuring is to maximize efficiency by having employees perform a broader range of duties and by eliminating jurisdictional and other barriers, which would interfere with\nmaximizing flexibility and productivity. This process began by replacing the hundreds of jobs existing under the 1999 USS and National BLAs and agreeing to new lines of progression (\"LOP\") for these new jobs.\n\n2. In order to achieve the workplace restructuring objective, the Parties have agreed to the following to govern its implementation:\n\na. A box (e.g., Analytical/Technical I, Salary Grade 3) in a LOP represents a position to which an Employee may hold incumbency. Former job titles listed inside a box in a LOP represent the duties of the position encompassed by that position box. Such a former job title is not a \"job\" as that term is used in the August 1, 1999 Basic Labor Agreement.\n\nb. Employees may be assigned to perform any function within their new position descriptions that they are capable of safely performing. Rotation through the various functions encompassed by the new positions will be necessary and required to provide and maintain job knowledge and skills.\n\nc. In periods of stable operations, where Employees have been fully trained such that maximum workforce flexibility and productivity is achieved, Employees may select their preferences to repetitive routine assignments within a new position box and shift preferences on the basis of seniority. These preferences will be honored, provided that the exercise of such preferences does\nnot interfere with new or refresher training, or the efficient utilization of the workforce. To this end, Employees may be temporarily reassigned to duties other than their preferred assignment as required by operations.\n\nd. Existing local seniority agreements and local working conditions will be eliminated or modified as appropriate to implement the new seniority structures and achieve the restructuring objective. Those seniority agreements and local working conditions unaffected by the foregoing will be preserved. Following implementation of the new seniority structures, Article Five, Section A and Article Five, Section E(2)(b) shall apply.\n\ne. Disputes over the implementation of this Appendix on Workplace Restructuring shall first be discussed by the Local Union President and Grievance Chair and the Plant Manager or his designated representative. Should agreement not be reached, the Local Union President may notify the Chairs of the Negotiating Committee that a dispute exists. The Chairs (or their designees) shall promptly meet and attempt to resolve the dispute. Should resolution not be achieved, the Union Chair may appeal the dispute to the Board of Arbitration. The matter will promptly be heard by the Chairman, if available, and the decision shall be final and binding only for the specific dispute presented. The Board shall have authority to resolve questions of procedure that\nmay arise in the course of such arbitrations. The sole issue before the Board shall be whether the disputed implementation action violates this Appendix.\n\nAPPENDIX C-2: LAYOFFS DURING RESTRUCTURING\n\nNo Employee will be laid off solely as a result of the initial workplace restructuring. Similarly, no Employee will be displaced to a Labor Grade lower than that to which he otherwise would have been slotted solely as the result of the initial workplace restructuring.\n\nAPPENDIX C-3: TRAINING FOR NEW OR RESTRUCTURED JOBS\n\n1. The Parties agree that the right to adequate training is fundamental to achieving the safe and successful implementation of our agreement to restructure jobs and the workplace.\n\n2. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, Employees who were, on the Effective Date, incumbents in a job which has subsequently been combined into a new or restructured job shall, subject to their seniority and the number of available positions, be provided an opportunity to be placed in such new or restructured job.\n\n3. The Parties recognize that certain new and/or restructured jobs may require skills, which certain newly incumbent Employees do not possess. In light of this situation, the Company agrees to provide Employees who do not have the required skills for their new or restructured jobs with reasonable training\nopportunities to ensure competent job performance.\n\n4. In the event that, despite the efforts described in Paragraph 3 above, the Employee is not capable of acquiring the new job skills, then the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to provide further training and the Employee shall be placed on a vacancy for which the Grievance Chair and the Plant Manager mutually agree he/she is qualified.\n\n5. The training programs necessary to carry out the provisions of this letter of understanding will be conducted during the Employee's normal working hours.\n\n6. No Employee will be disciplined for poor job performance that results from a failure of the Company to provide training pursuant to this letter of understanding or for failure to acquire new skills when returning to a new or restructured job.\n\n7. The Parties agreed that in order to maintain competent job performance, continuing familiarization and rotation within various assignments related to new and restructured job descriptions is both required and necessary.\n\nAPPENDIX D\u2014FORMER NATIONAL FACILITIES\n\nAPPENDIX D-1: ICD AT NATIONAL STEEL FACILITIES\n\nThe Parties reached the following understanding during the negotiation of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement regarding the Company's assumption of certain National Steel Corporation ICD liabilities. The Company agrees to assume responsibility for\nAPPENDIX F - Union Officer Bidding Rights\n\nNational Steel Corporation's ICD liability accrued as of the effective date of this Agreement. In addition, the Company agrees that it will honor approved National Steel ICD budgets for the year 2003.\n\nAPPENDIX D-2: TRANSITIONAL MATTERS APPLICABLE TO USWA-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AT FORMER NATIONAL STEEL FACILITIES\n\nThe document concerning transitional matters applicable to USWA represented Employees at former National Steel plants is part of this Basic Labor Agreement by reference and may be found in Exhibit C-1 to Appendix EE of the 2003 Settlement Agreement.\n\nAPPENDIX E\u2014TRANSITION MATTERS\n\nThe Transition Assistance Program and related documents are part of this Basic Labor Agreement by reference and are included in Appendix EE of the 2003 Settlement Agreement.\n\nAPPENDIX F\u2014UNION OFFICER BIDDING RIGHTS\n\n1. The Parties recognize that Employees should be neither advantaged nor disadvantaged because of their involvement in the Union. The Parties also recognize the legitimacy of the Company's need to insist upon making regular and dependable attendance a requirement when making assignments to jobs, where maintaining continuity is an important element of the position.\n2. This will confirm our understanding that, in order to balance and accommodate the concerns referenced above, no Local Union officer eligible to bid for a promotion shall be denied a job award and incumbency status on the position sought solely because of that Employee's unavailability for work due to the duties attendant their Local Union position. However, where a Local Union officer is awarded a job and becomes incumbent to a position that otherwise would have been denied to him because of unavailability due to his Local Union position, the Company, at its discretion, may decide to withhold assigning such Employee to that position until such time as he is available to perform the job as required. Instead, during any period of unavailability, the Company may assign another Employee, who can meet the job's attendance requirements, to work the position. When a Local Union officer is working below his incumbency status solely because of such Company action he shall receive a special allowance reflecting any difference in wages between what the Local Union officer earned while at work on the lower position and what the Employee, assigned by the Company to work on his incumbent position, was paid on turns when the Local Union officer was working on the lower position.\n\n3. This understanding supersedes prior inconsistent arbitration awards. It will apply to permanent vacancies awarded on or after the effective date of this Agreement.\nAPPENDIX G\u2014EXPERIMENTAL GRIEVANCE SCREENING\n\nAPPENDIX G-1: EXPERIMENTAL GRIEVANCE SCREENING PROCEDURE\n\nThe Parties recognize that it is desirable to resolve grievances without the need to resort to arbitration. In furtherance of that recognition the Parties agree to establish an Experimental Grievance Screening Procedure (hereinafter \"Procedure\") for the term of the May 20, 2003 Basic Labor Agreement\n\n1. Except as provided for in Appendix H-2, the Procedure shall be invoked only where mutually agreed to by the International Union President or his designated International Union representative and a member of the company's Headquarters Labor Relations staff (hereinafter \"screening representatives\").\n\n2. The screening representatives, if they elect to employ the Procedure, shall mutually schedule dates for Procedure meetings (hereinafter \"screening meetings\") and agree upon case agendas. No grievance shall be eligible for consideration under the procedure until docketed for arbitration or unless mutually agreed to by the Parties designated Step 3 representatives.\n\n3. The screening representatives shall mutually select the arbitrator (hereinafter \"screening arbitrator\") who will make determinations in accordance with this Procedure.\n\n4. The screening representatives will jointly submit the official grievance record(s) of each scheduled case to the designated screening arbitrator no later than 30 days prior to the date of the screening meeting.\n5. Attendance at the screening meeting shall be limited to: the screening arbitrator, a representative from the International Union, no more than two representatives of the grievance committee, a member of the Company Headquarters Labor Relations staff, and the Plant Manager of Labor Relations or his/her representative.\n\n6. The Company, Union and screening arbitrator will review and analyze the issue presented by each grievance in an effort to fully determine its merit or lack of merit.\n\n7. The screening Arbitrator will immediately advise the Parties as to his/her interpretation of the issues presented and as to how s/he would decide the case if such case were presented to arbitration. The Parties are not obliged to follow the screening arbitrator's recommendations and retain the right to pursue the grievance. The screening arbitrator's recommendation and statements, as well as all positions and arguments advanced by either Party concerning that grievance, shall not be introduced or in any way mentioned in any subsequent hearing before the Board of Arbitration.\n\n8. If a grievance is not resolved pursuant to the Procedure, and is later heard before the Board of Arbitration, the screening arbitrator will not be assigned to decide the case.\n\n9. In the event the Parties agree to resolve a grievance or grievances, that agreement shall be in writing and signed by a representative of the International Union and a member of the Company's\nHeadquarters Labor Relations Staff. Such agreements shall not serve as precedent nor may they be referred to any other case.\n\nAPPENDIX G-2: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRIEVANCE SCREENING PROCEDURE\n\n1. The Parties agree that it would be desirable to attempt to reduce the backlog of grievances docketed at the Board of Arbitration and to implement procedures aimed at preventing future backlogs. To this end, it is agreed that the Experimental Grievance Screening Procedure set forth in Appendix H-1 will be invoked with respect to grievances docketed by the Board as of the Effective Date of this Agreement at each location where a given Local Union has in excess of 150 grievances so docketed.\n\n2. With respect to grievances docketed by the Board of Arbitration subsequent to the Effective Date of this Agreement, it is agreed that as of the end of the first calendar month where the number of such grievances from a given Local Union docketed by the Board reaches 150, the Appendix H-1 procedure will be invoked with the result that the number of such docketed grievances remaining unscreened is reduced to no more than 100 within 45 days. Thereafter, the number of docketed unscreened grievances from that Local Union will be counted at the end of each succeeding month and where the number of such grievances exceeds 150, the Appendix H-1 procedure similarly will be invoked so that the number of docketed, unscreened grievances counted for that month will be reduced to no more than 100 within 45 days.\n3. The logistics surrounding the implementation of the screening procedure at each location will be agreed to by a designated representative of the Company Headquarters' Staff and a designated representative of the International Union. Where appropriate, the Parties may agree to pre-screening procedure meetings where matters such as the types of issue involved and opportunities for settlement may be discussed.\n\nAPPENDIX H\u2014RETENTION OF PREEXISTING AGREEMENTS\n\n1. All Other USS Agreements and Other National Agreements are continued in full force and effect unless:\n   a. expressly modified by this LOA; or\n   b. in conflict with the USS-National CBA.\n2. To avoid misunderstanding concerning the above, the Parties agree that the following agreements shall be continued:\n   a. East Chicago Tin Agreement dated February 26, 2001,\n   b. Gary Coke 6-year Agreement,\n   c. Fairless Agreement dated October 19, 2001, and\n   d. The Provisions of the Fairfield Agreements not relating to contracting out (except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties).\n3. To avoid misunderstanding concerning the above, the Parties agree that the following agreements shall be terminated:\nAPPENDIX I - Applicability of Neutrality\n\na. Gary Attrition Rate Reduction Plan Agreement dated March 18, 1994, and\n\nb. Provisions of the Fairfield Agreements relating to contracting out as determined in the 2003 negotiations.\n\nAPPENDIX I\u2014APPLICABILITY OF NEUTRALITY\n\n1. During negotiations the Parties carefully reviewed activities conducted at the existing non-union Ventures of the Company. These discussions established that none of those operations engages in the making of steel or the mining of iron ore. With that importantly in mind, the Parties agree that the Neutrality Section will under no circumstances apply to the current location of an entity which is a Venture of the Company as of March, 29, 2003 (hereinafter \"Exempted Entity\") provided that after March 29, 2003 (1) the Company does not increase its ownership in, or acquire the right to direct the management and policies of the Exempted Entity such that it becomes an Affiliate, (2) the Exempted Entity does not materially change the nature of its business activities at such location, and (3) the Exempted Entity does not materially expand its facilities.\n\n2. In the event that any of the above conditions are no longer satisfied at an Exempted Entity, then the Neutrality Section shall be immediately fully applicable at such Exempted Entity.\n3. As of March 29, 2003 the only entities potentially meeting this criteria, their current location, and the nature of the business activities conducted at such location are:\na. PRO-TEC Coating Company, Leipsic, OH (sheet finishing and processing)\nb. Worthington Specialty Processing, Jackson, MI (sheet finishing and processing)\nc. USS/CHC, doing business as Delta Tubular Processing \u2013 Houston, TX (pipe finishing and processing)\n\n4. Notwithstanding the exemption from Neutrality Section coverage described above, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to:\na. Convince the Board of Directors and Management at the Exempted Entities referred to above to accept the Neutrality clause, Article Two, Section E of the Basic Labor Agreement.\nb. Arrange for a meeting between the Management of each such Exempted Entity, the Union and the Company, at which meeting the Company will clearly express its support for the Exempted Entity accepting the terms of the Neutrality clause, Article Two, Section E of the Basic Labor Agreement.\nc. Take other similar actions as may be mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union.\n\n5. In addition, the Parties agree that the Neutrality Section will under no\ncircumstances apply to unrepresented employees of the Company located at its Headquarters. The Company's Headquarters is currently located at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nAPPENDIX J\u2014USWA REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES OF FUTURE ACQUIRED FACILITIES\n\nIn the event that U.S. Steel purchases the assets of another steel company during the term of the 2003 Basic Labor Agreement, and the employees of that company are covered by a United Steelworkers of America Basic Steel Labor Agreement, such employees will be credited with their Basic Labor Agreement Service with that company, in the same manner as was done with National Steel employees pursuant to Article Five, Section E(3)(b).\n\nAPPENDIX K\u2014INFORMATION REQUESTS REGARDING NEW HIRES\n\nMonthly lists of new hires and transfers into the bargaining unit will be made available upon request at the plant level to the Financial Secretary of each Local Union. If the number of additions is sufficient to justify reporting on a more frequent basis, an effort will be made to do so. It should be understood that in the interest of prompt reporting these lists will be preliminary and, accordingly, subject to verification by the regular monthly Union membership and checkoff list which will be transmitted in accordance with existing procedures.\nAPPENDIX L\u2014TUITION ASSISTANCE PLAN\n\n1. Purpose. The purpose of the Tuition Assistance Plan (The Plan) is to aid an encourage eligible employees to supplement their education on their own time in order to assist them in maintaining and improving their working skills. This may be done through an approved program leading to a recognized degree or by individually approved courses subject to the provisions of this Section.\n\n2. Coverage\n\na. Employee Eligibility. All Employees actively at work (other than part-time employees), with two years or more of continuous service, are eligible to participate in the Plan. Approval for participation is based on concurrence by Management the proposed course of study or degree program meets the requirements of subsection b below. An eligible Employee must secure the prior approval of Management to undertake a specific course of study at a specific institution. To qualify the course must be taken on the Employee's own time and approved when the Employee is actively at work. The course must be of such a nature that it will not interfere with the Employee's performance of his/her regular duties. In case an eligible Employee quits or is discharged prior to completion of an approved course of study, he shall not be entitled to any financial assistance under this Plan.\nb. Course Requirements. Courses to be taken by eligible Employees must cover recognized undergraduate or graduate courses or individually approved courses such as certain correspondence courses. These may include courses leading to a degree or professional certification. The course must be made up of content that has not been covered under any previous financial assistance under the Plan or that is not offered at reasonable intervals at the Employee's location under training programs or the Corporation's Advanced Technical Study Program, except as may be required for degree or professional certification purposes and similar no-grade, noncredit courses are not eligible for financial assistance.\n\n3. Financial Assistance\n\nWhen an approved course has been satisfactorily completed, the Corporation will refund to eligible Employees fifty percent (50%) of the cost of tuition. Registration, laboratory and other fees required by the institution, less state or federal taxes, if any are applicable, subject to the following conditions:\n\na. The maximum amount of any financial assistance shall be $400.00 within any twelve (12) month period.\n\nb. The cost of related expenses such as books, special laboratory equipment, refundable laboratory (breakage) fees, transportation, meals or postage will not be reimbursed.\n\nc. Certain special fees are the responsibility of the employee such as\nEntrance Examination Fees, Late Registration Fees, Substitute Examination Fees, or fees of like nature caused by the Employee's individual desires or failures to act.\n\nd. The Employee must submit evidence AL.8 of satisfactory completion of an approved course and receipts showing the amount of tuition or fees paid. Satisfactory completion of a course means the level of performance designated by the institution as passing.\n\ne. Employees participating in the program who are eligible to receive tuition benefits resulting from service in the armed forces, federal aid or scholarship aid will be eligible to receive from the Corporation only fifty percent (50%) of the portion of tuition and required fees not covered by such benefits.\n\nf. Financial assistance for approved courses completed satisfactorily while the Employee is on leave of absence or layoff will be paid, provided the Employee was actively at work at the time his/her participation in the course was approved. No financial assistance will be payable for courses taken or contracted for prior to employment or while the Employee is on leave of absence or layoff status, even though he may complete them after returning to active employment.\n\ng. An Employee who is unable to continue an approved course because of action by the Company (other than discharge), or because of a change in his job or job assignment shall be AL.11\nreimbursed fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the amount of his advance payments for tuition, registration, laboratory and other fees required by the institution, and the amount of the refund to which the student may be entitled by the institution's regulations by virtue of the discontinuance of the course.\n\n4. Administration. All Employees' applications for participation in this Plan must be filed by the Employee with the appropriate responsibility at the employing location sufficiently in advance of the start of a course to allow Management to complete all approvals\n\nAPPENDIX M\u2014SERVICE BONUS\n\n1. The purpose of this Service Bonus Plan (SBP) is to provide a bonus for hours worked by eligible Employees, with the amount of bonus per hour increasing in relation to the Employee's length of continuous service.\n\n2. Definitions\nWhen used in this SBP or in any agreement relating thereto, the following terms are intended to have the meaning set forth below:\n\na. \"Employees covered by this SBP\" are Employees covered by the Basic Labor Agreement.\n\nb. \"Eligible Employees\" are Employees covered by this SBP who have 5 or more years of continuous service as of the calculation date and who have some hours worked in the calculation period.\nc. Calculation Period\n\nAugust 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003\nAugust 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004\nAugust 1, 2004 through July 31, 2005\nAugust 1, 2005 through July 31, 2006\nAugust 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007\nAugust 1, 2007 through July 31, 2008\n\nd. \"Calculation Date\" is the last day of each calculation period.\n\ne. \"Continuous Service\" is the continuous service of an Employee as determined for pension purposes under the Company's non-contributory pension plan.\n\nf. \"Hours Worked\" are the hours worked by Employees covered by this SBP on jobs in the bargaining unit covered by the Basic Labor Agreement.\n\ng. \"Service Bonus Pool\" is an amount determined for each calculation period by multiplying 55 cents by the sum of all hours worked during the calculation period and adding there-to 55 cents for each hour an Employee of the Company not covered by this SBP works on a job in the bargaining unit covered by the this Agreement.\n\n3. Service Bonus\n\na. Each eligible Employee shall be paid a Service Bonus, calculated for each calculation period by multiplying the Employee's bonus credits for the calculation period by the bonus payment rate for such calculation period.\n\nb. The bonus credits for each eligible Employee shall be determined by\nmultiplying (1) the sum of the number of hours worked by the Employee at straight time plus 1.5 times the number of hours worked by the Employee at overtime rates in the calculation period by (2) the bonus credit factors shown in the following table, determined on the basis of the Employee's years of continuous service as of the calculation date:\n\nc. Years of Service    Bonus Credit Factor\n   5 but less than 10 years      .5\n   10 but less than 15 years     .8\n   15 but less than 20 years     1.1\n   20 but less than 25 years     1.4\n   25 but less than 30 years     1.7\n   30 but less than 35 years     2.0\n   35 but less than 40 years     2.3\n   40 years and over             2.6\n\nd. The bonus payment rate for a calculation period shall be the result determined by dividing the sum of all the bonus credits of all eligible Employees for the calculation period into the Service Bonus Pool for such calculation period.\n\ne. The Service Bonus will be paid with the pay for the first pay period closed in November following the applicable calculation period.\n\nf. No Service Bonus will be payable to any Employee for the calculation period in which the Employee quits or is discharged.\n\ng. Except as provided in Subsection e above, if an Employee covered by this SBP ceases to be so covered during a calculation period and after completing at least five years of con-\ntinuous service, payment of a Service Bonus is to be made to the Employee or on the Employee's behalf as though the Employee had continuous service on the calculation date equal to the continuous service the Employee had on the date coverage by this SBP ceased.\n\nh. Service Bonus shall be payable only for hours worked, as described above, and shall not be part of the Employee's pay for any other purpose and shall not be used in the calculation of any other pay, allowance, or benefit.\n\ni. At the time of payment of the Service Bonus for each calculation period, the Company will provide the International Union and the Local Union with a report, on the form agreed upon, covering the operation of the Service Bonus Plan for such calculation period.\n\nAPPENDIX N\u2014OFFICE AND TECHNICAL BARGAINING UNIT AT MINNESOTA ORE OPERATIONS\n\nThe parties agree that the Agreement covering the Office and Technical Bargaining Unit at Minnesota Ore Operations constitutes a separate labor agreement, the terms and conditions of which shall, with the exception of the provisions described below, be those set forth in this Basic Labor Agreement covering Office and Technical Employees. Bold Text indicates a difference between the Minnesota Ore Operations O & T BLA and the O & T BLA.\n1. Article Two, Section A(1) shall state:\n\nThe Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit made up of individuals occupying salaried office clerical, salaried technical and salaried mine clerical jobs at Minnesota Ore Operations. Individuals within this bargaining unit shall be known as \"Employees.\" The term \"Employees\" excludes only production and maintenance bargaining unit employees, managers, confidential employees, supervisors and guards as defined under the National Labor Relations Act. Individuals who are employed by the Company and are not in this bargaining unit shall be known as \"non-bargaining unit employees.\" Individuals who are in the bargaining unit and those who are not in the bargaining unit shall be known collectively as \"employees.\"\n\n2. Article Five, Section C(7)(a) shall state:\n\nThe Company may adopt alternative work schedules consisting of ten (10) or twelve (12) hour per day scheduling with the approval of the Local Union President/Unit Chair, the District #11 Director and sixty percent (60%) of the Employees who are impacted by the alternative schedule.\n\n3. Temporary vacancies in the salaried assignments of Quality Assurance Coordinator and Expediter will be filled in accord with the existing agreements in the local parties.\nAPPENDIX O\u2014PLANTS COVERED BY THE BLA\n\nSalaried Office and Technical\nUSS Clairton\nUSS East Chicago Tin\nUSS Edgar Thomson\nUSS Fairfield\nUSS Fairless\nUSS Gary Sheet and Tin\nUSS Gary Steel\nUSS Granite City\nUSS Great Lakes\nUSS Irvin\nUSS Lorain Tubular\nUSS Midwest\nUSS Minnesota Ore Operations\n\nLocation\nClairton, PA\nEast Chicago, IN\nBraddock, PA\nFairfield, AL\nFairless Hills, PA\nGary, IN\nGary, IN\nGranite City, IL\nEcorse, MI\nDravosburg, PA\nLorain, OH\nPortage, IN\nMt.
