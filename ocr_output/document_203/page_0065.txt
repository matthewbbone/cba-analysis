month of that quarter will be compared to a CPI Threshold (as found in the Table in Paragraph 5 below) which represents what the CPI would be if total inflation since the beginning of the Agreement had averaged three percent (3%) per year. If the actual CPI is higher than the CPI Threshold, a lump sum payment shall be made equal to each full one percent (1.0%) by which the actual CPI is higher than the CPI Threshold, multiplied by the hourly equivalent Salary Rate of Pay for each position worked by an Employee for all hours actually worked and overtime allowance (hereafter referred to as "earnings") for the quarter.

Thus, if in a given quarter three percent (3%) annual inflation since the beginning of the Agreement would have produced total inflation of ten percent (10%) and the actual CPI indicates that inflation since the beginning of the contract has been twelve percent (12%) and an Employee had earnings as defined in the paragraph above during the quarter of $12,000, then that Employee would receive a lump-sum payment of two percent (2%) (12% actual inflation minus a 10% CPI Threshold) times $12,000 or $240.
