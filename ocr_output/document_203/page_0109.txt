APPENDIX G—EXPERIMENTAL GRIEVANCE SCREENING

APPENDIX G-1: EXPERIMENTAL GRIEVANCE SCREENING PROCEDURE

The Parties recognize that it is desirable to resolve grievances without the need to resort to arbitration. In furtherance of that recognition the Parties agree to establish an Experimental Grievance Screening Procedure (hereinafter "Procedure") for the term of the May 20, 2003 Basic Labor Agreement

1. Except as provided for in Appendix H-2, the Procedure shall be invoked only where mutually agreed to by the International Union President or his designated International Union representative and a member of the company's Headquarters Labor Relations staff (hereinafter "screening representatives").

2. The screening representatives, if they elect to employ the Procedure, shall mutually schedule dates for Procedure meetings (hereinafter "screening meetings") and agree upon case agendas. No grievance shall be eligible for consideration under the procedure until docketed for arbitration or unless mutually agreed to by the Parties designated Step 3 representatives.

3. The screening representatives shall mutually select the arbitrator (hereinafter "screening arbitrator") who will make determinations in accordance with this Procedure.

4. The screening representatives will jointly submit the official grievance record(s) of each scheduled case to the designated screening arbitrator no later than 30 days prior to the date of the screening meeting.
