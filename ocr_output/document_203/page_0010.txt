c. On each hearing date the Parties shall, subject to the time available, attempt to present all cases scheduled for arbitration. The cases, unless agreed otherwise, shall be scheduled in the order in which they were appealed, provided that all pending discharge cases shall be scheduled first, and provided further that either Party may seek agreement from the other to have a case scheduled out of order for good cause, such request not to be unreasonably denied.

d. Failure to present a case at a scheduled hearing shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance and failure to respond to a case when presented shall constitute granting of the grievance and agreement to the remedy sought, provided that a hearing may be postponed once if the Board determines that circumstances clearly require postponement. However, the Parties may agree to postpone a grievance scheduled for arbitration.
