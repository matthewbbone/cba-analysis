APPENDIX G-2: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRIEVANCE SCREENING PROCEDURE

1. The Parties agree that it would be desirable to attempt to reduce the backlog of grievances docketed at the Board of Arbitration and to implement procedures aimed at preventing future backlogs. To this end, it is agreed that the Experimental Grievance Screening Procedure set forth in Appendix H-1 will be invoked with respect to grievances docketed by the Board as of the Effective Date of this Agreement at each location where a given Local Union has in excess of 150 grievances so docketed.

2. With respect to grievances docketed by the Board of Arbitration subsequent to the Effective Date of this Agreement, it is agreed that as of the end of the first calendar month where the number of such grievances from a given Local Union docketed by the Board reaches 150, the Appendix H-1 procedure will be invoked with the result that the number of such docketed grievances remaining unscreened is reduced to no more than 100 within 45 days. Thereafter, the number of docketed unscreened grievances from that Local Union will be counted at the end of each succeeding month and where the number of such grievances exceeds 150, the Appendix H-1 procedure similarly will be invoked so that the number of docketed, unscreened grievances counted for that month will be reduced to no more than 100 within 45 days.
