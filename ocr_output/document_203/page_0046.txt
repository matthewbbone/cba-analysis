on jobs within a pool of sufficient Labor Grade 1 positions to provide meaningful protection from long term layoff for senior Employees.

3. Employee Protections

Reference to the elements of a Layoff Minimization Plan in Paragraph 2 above shall not be construed to impair in any way any protection afforded to Employees under other provisions of this Agreement.

4. Union Response

The Union shall be provided with sufficient information to reach its own judgment on whether there is a Need, the appropriate Impact and to develop its own proposed Layoff Minimization Plan.

5. Dispute Resolution

a. In the event the Parties cannot reach agreement on whether there is a Need, the appropriate Impact and the terms of a Layoff Minimization Plan, the Company may implement its plan and the Union may submit their dispute to an expedited final offer arbitration under procedures to be developed by the Parties. If the Company lays off Employees in violation of this Section, such Employees shall be made whole.

b. The arbitrator's ruling shall address whether the Company demonstrated a Need and if it did, whose proposed Impact and Layoff Minimization Plan was more reasonable, given all the circumstances and the objectives of the Parties.
