e. Any grievance appealed to this mini-arbitration procedure must be confined to issues which do not involve novel problems and which have limited contractual significance or complexity. If the Union appeals a grievance to the Board of Arbitration under circumstances where it is clear from the issue embodied in the grievance that jurisdiction to resolve the grievance lies solely within the min-arbitration procedure and should the Board conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over the grievance, the Union, after such award, may not thereafter appeal such grievance to mini-arbitration; provided, however, that if it is unclear from the issue embodied in such grievance whether jurisdiction to resolve the grievance lies solely within the mini-arbitration procedure, but the Board concludes that it lacks jurisdiction, the Union may appeal such grievance to mini-arbitration within ten (10) days of the date of such award.
