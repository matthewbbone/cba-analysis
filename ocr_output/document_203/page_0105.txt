APPENDIX C-2: LAYOFFS DURING RESTRUCTURING

No Employee will be laid off solely as a result of the initial workplace restructuring. Similarly, no Employee will be displaced to a Labor Grade lower than that to which he otherwise would have been slotted solely as the result of the initial workplace restructuring.

APPENDIX C-3: TRAINING FOR NEW OR RESTRUCTURED JOBS

1. The Parties agree that the right to adequate training is fundamental to achieving the safe and successful implementation of our agreement to restructure jobs and the workplace.

2. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, Employees who were, on the Effective Date, incumbents in a job which has subsequently been combined into a new or restructured job shall, subject to their seniority and the number of available positions, be provided an opportunity to be placed in such new or restructured job.

3. The Parties recognize that certain new and/or restructured jobs may require skills, which certain newly incumbent Employees do not possess. In light of this situation, the Company agrees to provide Employees who do not have the required skills for their new or restructured jobs with reasonable training
