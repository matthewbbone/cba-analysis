Step 2    Appeals to the Second Step of the grievance procedure must be made within ten (10) days following the date of the First Step answer was received. Appeals will be directed to the 1199C President, or his designee.

A Second Step hearing will be held at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties. The 1199C President or his designee shall preside for the Employer, and the Shop Steward and OPEIU Local 32 Representative shall preside for the union. The individual designated by the President shall not be the same individual who presided for the Employer at the First Step Meeting.

The Second Step answer shall be given to the Union within ten (10) days following conclusion of the hearing(s).

14.3    Either party may elect to include additional representatives at any step of the Grievance Procedure.

14.4    Mediation
A grievance may only be referred to mediation by mutual agreement of the parties. The mediator shall be jointly selected by the parties, or, if no agreement can be reached, through the procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The mediator shall not sit as an arbitrator in any case for which he has participated as a mediator.

14.5    Arbitration
The Union will have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Second Step response, in which to appeal the grievance to arbitration.

Appeals to arbitration will be made by letter to the President of 1199C.
The Arbitrator may be mutually agreed to by the parties within twenty (20) days after the date of the appeal notice. If there is no mutual selection, the appeal will then be filed with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) for the selection of an arbitrator. The appeal to AAA shall be filed within ten (10) days following the expiration of the twenty (20) day period under this paragraph.

The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. Decisions are to be rendered within thirty (30) days following of the final presentation of evidence, unless a transcript is requested and/or briefs are submitted in which case the time period shall be extended.

Expenses of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party will be responsible for the cost of its representation.

14.6    Time Limits
Time limits of the grievance and arbitration procedures may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Any step of the grievance procedure may be mutually waived by the parties.
