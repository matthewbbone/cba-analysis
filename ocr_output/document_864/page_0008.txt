ARTICLE 14: GRIEVANCE & ARBITRATION PROCEDURES

14.1 Grievance Procedure
Any complaint or dispute between an employee and/or the Union and the Employer, concerning the interpretation or application of the provisions of the Agreement or any questions relating to wages, hours of work, or other conditions of employment, shall be resolved in accordance with this Article. However, it is the intent of the parties to resolve any and all disputes at the earliest possible step of the grievance process.

Class action grievances filed by the Union on behalf of a group of employees, matters relating to contract interpretation, job classification or wage administration, and discharge cases will be filed directly at Step Two, within fifteen (15) days after the Union had knowledge, or should have had knowledge, of the event which caused the grievance or complaint.

There shall be no individual agreements between the employees and the Employer.

14.2 Step 1
An employee who believes a grievance or complaint exists will discuss such matter with the immediate supervisor; with or without a Shop Steward present, as the employee may elect. In the event the dispute remains unresolved, the employee may submit a grievance in writing within fifteen (15) days after the employee had knowledge, or should have had knowledge, of the event which caused the grievance or complaint.

After a grievance or complaint has been submitted to the immediate supervisor, the supervisor shall conduct a First Step Meeting within five (5) days. The supervisor or his designee shall preside for the Employer, and a Shop Steward shall preside for the Union. The supervisor shall respond in writing to the Union within seven (7) days.
