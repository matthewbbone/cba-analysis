ARTICLE 19: PAID SICK LEAVE

19.1 Sick leave is defined as "an absence of an employee from work for reason of illness or accident, or the illness or accident of a family member. Sick leave may also be used to attend medical appointments.

19.2 Employees shall accrue one (1) sick leave day per month for the first year of employment, for a maximum of twelve (12) days. After the first and subsequent years of employment, twelve (12) sick leave days shall be advanced to the employee on his anniversary dates.

19.3 Sick leave may be taken in daily, half day, or hourly increments.

19.4 Sick Leave Accrual - Employees shall be entitled to accrue a maximum of sixty-five (65) sick days.

19.5 Payment of Sick Time – Sick time shall only be paid for sick time taken or as provided in Article 19.6. In the event that an employee works on a day that has been approved as sick time, the employee shall be paid only for day worked and sick time shall be returned to the employees’ sick time balance.

Effective January 1, 2020 Employees will be able to cash out their sick days at the time of their anniversary date. Employees can buy back sick time once the employee has exceeded the maximum accrual of 65 days, in effort for employees to not lose any sick days.
