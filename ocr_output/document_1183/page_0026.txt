ARTICLE 6 - DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION

Section 1 - Discharge and Disciplinary Action
The Company shall not discharge or suspend an employee without just cause and shall, under normal disciplinary action, give at least two (2) warning notices of the complaint against such employee with a copy given to the employee and Local Union. Warning notices shall have no force or effect after nine (9) months from the date hereof. Copies of warning notices shall be mailed to the Local Union office within seven (7) calendar days from the date the warning notice was issued.

Where a major infraction of normal rules takes place and the safety of employees or proper operations of the plant is at stake, such as drinking of alcoholic beverages while on duty, possession of narcotics on Company property, or engaging in brawls or fights, the Company retains the right to discharge immediately. In such cases, the Union must be notified immediately, but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours.

Section 2 - Right to Grieve
An employee shall have the right to grieve a warning notice, suspension, or discharge by presenting a grievance in writing to the Company within five (5) working days, excluding Saturday and Sunday, of such warning notice, suspension, or discharge. Such grievance shall be processed under the provisions of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure set forth in Article 7; provided, however, that a warning notice shall be processed only through Steps 1 and 2 of the Grievance Procedure and thereafter directly to Arbitration if requested by either party.

ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION

Section 1 - No Strike/No Lockout
The Union and the Company agree that there shall be no strikes, lockouts, tie-ups, or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of a settlement, as provided for in this Agreement, of any controversy which might arise.
