paychecks by fifty-two (52) multiplied by the number of calendar years over which the accumulation has been made. [For example, if the thirty (30) or more paychecks are accumulated over a two (2) calendar year period, the hours worked in accumulating such paychecks would be divided by one hundred four (104).]

Section 6

Any employee (except new employees covered under Section 3) who shall not receive at least thirty (30) paychecks in any calendar year shall be entitled to accumulate paychecks for vacation entitlement until, as of December 31 of any calendar year, such employee has received a minimum of thirty (30) paychecks; provided, however, that an employee must receive at least eight (8) paychecks in a calendar year before such paychecks may be used for accumulation purposes. Workers' Compensation checks will not be counted for the purposes of (this) Section 6.

Section 7

The Company shall have the right to determine the vacation period during which vacations shall be taken by eligible employees. Departmental seniority (actual date of last hire) shall prevail in the choice of vacation periods, subject to the Company's right to reasonably restrict the number of employees in each department who shall be off at any one time.

All requests for vacation during the year must be submitted to the Human Resources office not later than February 1. Requests after that will be scheduled as they are received in accordance with this Section, but without a right to claim any vacation time previously scheduled.

The Company may provide for a one (1) or two (2) week period each year during which time appropriate plant operations shall cease and employees with sufficient vacation eligibility for that year who are not scheduled to work shall take that time off as paid vacation. Each plant location will determine the shutdown period and will notify employees of the dates for plant shutdown by February 15 of each calendar year.
