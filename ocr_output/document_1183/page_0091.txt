Any employee, regardless of his skill level, can earn such recognition by demonstrating his skill and ability against a pre-established skill set. If they satisfy the criteria for the skill category being evaluated, the employee must be re-evaluated after (1) three years from date of recognition since criteria or technology in the plant changes if the employee did not pass the evaluation, the employee must wait 180 calendar days before requesting another evaluation, regardless of skill category. The employee must re-qualify annually thereafter to maintain superior skill recognition and pay "Add-on". The employee may seek recognition in the same or different categories and as many times as he qualifies for each category.

Panel can periodically agree to modify these categories.

3. The employee must submit a written request for an evaluation to demonstrate attainment of superior skills. Employees that successfully complete the skill evaluation for the next higher level will receive a pay "Add-on". The employee must request the "first full" Pay Add-on following completion of the time in grade requirement (or date of request if later). The employee will be ineligible to request for advancement (for 180) calendar days upon failure to successfully pass their requested evaluation. The employee will demonstrate his skills against a pre-established set of skill criteria and the "evaluation" will be conducted under principles similar to those in Section I; Paragraph B, (5) and (6), above.

4. Any dispute resulting from such evaluations shall be resolved in accordance with the grievance procedure of this Agreement. In the event of any arbitration arising out of such evaluation, the arbitrator will be selected from a panel of persons who are skilled in maintenance.
