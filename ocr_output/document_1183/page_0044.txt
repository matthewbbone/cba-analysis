Section 8

In addition to as provided in Section 3(B) and 5(B) of this Article, an employee may request pay in lieu of vacation, provided he takes a minimum of one (1) week of actual time. The request must be made at the time vacation requests are turned in. Vacation benefits may not be carried from one calendar year to the next, except under the provisions of Section 5(B).

If any employee is laid off or granted a leave of absence in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or after January 1 of any calendar year gives notice of resignation and has qualified for a vacation benefit, then such employee shall be paid an amount equal to such accrued vacation benefit in lieu thereof. No such payment for vacation; however, shall be made to an employee who is terminated by reason of discharge.

Employees who retire from the Company (immediately eligible to receive an early or normal retirement pension from Banquet Employees/Unions Pension Fund) during the year will receive a pro-rated vacation if they otherwise qualify.

If an employee has at least one (1) year of service and gives the Company at least one (1) week advance notice of resignation, the employee will be provided pro-rata vacation on the same basis as retirees who receive pro-rata vacation.

Section 9

Checks for vacation pay will be available for eligible employees on their last pay day prior to their vacation, emergency/non-previously scheduled vacations excepted.

Schedule permitting, employees upon written request shall not be required to work the sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day of the week prior to their vacation. Employees shall not be required to work on what would normally be their sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) workday during the week of their vacation.
