The plant operations will be divided into three (3) departments: Processing, Maintenance, and Plant Truck Driver. Departmental lines will not be crossed in effecting forced reductions.\n\nIn the event of a layoff of seven (7) work days or less, preference employees will be laid off before new class is affected. Next the junior employee(s) in the affected trade and shift will be laid off.\n\nA waiver sheet will be made available for employees in upgrade classifications who do not wish to be assigned outside their work term. This waiver sheet will be: known by seniority. Such a waiver sheet will remain effective for a minimum of three (3) months.\n\nLayoffs, of (14)h. (8) work days or more, the Company shall observe the principle of departmental seniority provided that the employee's trade, shift and skill is affected in the same process, plant, or function as the layoff. Recall will be in reverse order of the layoff; provided the recalled employee has the ability and skill to perform the available work in an efficient manner; and in accomplishing the recall, the Company shall retransfer employees who in the process of the layoff have been transferred to different jobs or different shifts. Retransfer rights shall expire after eighteen (18) months from the date of layoff. Retransfer rights shall be applicable only to those employees who remain on the active payroll after being displaced in another shift or occupation during the course of a permanent workforce reduction.

Recall shall be accomplished in seniority order.\n\nIn recalling a laid-off employee, the Company shall attempt to locate and notify such employee by telephone or failing in that by certified mail at his last known address. In the event the Company is unable to contact a laid-off employee, or if the employee has been contacted and requested to return to work but fails to do so within five (5) calendar days of such request an employment right of such employee may be considered. Failure of an employee to keep the Company informed as to his current address by telephone or certified mail shall relieve the Company of any responsibility to recall a laid-off employee.\n\nSection 5 - Job Bidding: When a permanent vacancy occurs within the Processing Department, a notice of such vacancy shall be posted on or before the fourth (4th) working day following the day the vacancy becomes known to the Company if vacancy is to be filled.

If an eligible, qualified person fails to return the preliminary employment express interest in the job will be considered for such vacancy.\n\n4. The senior employee who is unvoted on a job bid shall have up to five (5) days to qualify for each opening. After the employee is deemed qualified, a replacement bid will be posted. This five (5) day period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. If the employee has previously held the bid job within the last two (2) years, the five (5) day qualification period does not apply.\n\n5. In this event such employee's seniority would return to his/her previous rank and shift.\n\n6. The next senior person would be assigned from the original bid sheet and would begin on up to five (5) days to qualify.\n\n7. When a successful bidder is awarded a job, then during the trial period elect to return to their previous jobs, he/she will be restricted from additional bidding for a period of four (4) months from the date the job was awarded.
