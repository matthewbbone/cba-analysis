to the reoccupation of the "displaced" employee held immediately prior to his present occupation. If displaced employee shall elect not to exercise their recalled right when the first opportunity exists, they shall forfeit all such recalled rights for future reapplication or recall rights that may be granted in a similar order.

In the case of an indefinite layoff in any department, the displaced employees may apply for any vacancy for which they are qualified and have the ability to perform in other departments in the plant. Such employee shall be given preference over new hires to fill such vacancy in accordance with their plant seniority. Any such employee who is selected by the Company to fill such a vacancy in another department shall thereafter serve as recalled employee, as so determined for layoff and recall purposes on the basis of the date upon which he filled the vacancy.

Employees on temporary permanent layoff, whose employment status has changed from that of inactive employment to that of inactive employment, shall be subject only to recall to an opening after the job bidding process involving active employees has been completed. Recall shall be accomplished in seniority order.

In recalling a laid-off employee, the Company shall attempt to locate and notify such employee by telephone or failing in that by certified mail at his last known address. In the event the Company is unable to contact a laid-off employee, or if the employee has been contacted and requested to return to work but fails to do so within five (5) calendar days of such request an employment right of such employee may be considered. Failure of an employee to keep the Company informed as to his current address by telephone or certified mail shall relieve the Company of any responsibility to recall a laid-off employee.

Section 5 - Job Bidding: When a permanent vacancy occurs within the Processing Department, a notice of such vacancy shall be posted on or before the fourth (4th) working day following the day the vacancy becomes known to the Company if vacancy is to be filled. In cases of retirement, or where an employee gives advance notice of their intent to vacate a position, a notice of such decision must be posted not more than ten (10) days prior at the earliest and on each work day. Such notice shall be posted for a period of three (3) working days and any employee in the department in which the vacancy has occurred desiring to submit a bid for such vacancy must do so in writing within such three (3) day period. The senior employee who bids for such vacancy shall be assigned thereto within ten (10) working days thereafter, provided that the successful bidder is capable of performing the job according to the requirements and in comparison to other employees performing the same job and is capable of learning to satisfactorily perform the job.
