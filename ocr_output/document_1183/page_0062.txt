be exempt from this procedure; however, such transition from the line will be accomplished by seniority.

Section 11 - Maintenance

Future vacancies for the Waste Water Treatment Operator will be posted as "Maintenance/Treatment Operator" with a Maintenance Entry Level rate of pay. Employees within the Maintenance/Treatment Operator classification must achieve State Level 2 Certification within 18-24 months. Current Treatment Operators will be grandfathered in their current position but may choose to "transfer" into the Maintenance/Treatment Operator classification and doing so would be subject to the same conditions as future employees.

Section 12 - Temporary/Casual Workers

The temporary/casual status will be defined and (revised) in the future as follows:

• Temporary/Casual employees working 60 worked days will attain seniority status and become full time employees if permanent employment status would be attained;

• Retired will be allowed to work part-time (temporary) or otherwise through the Temp Agency at the Company's discretion and exclusive of the 60 day provision.

(Temporary/Casual employees who work any part of a workday shall be considered to have worked one (1) day)

The Union will be furnishing a list of Temporary/Casual employees for weeks in advance with the employee's name, date of last worked. Retiring working and retired temporary employees would be excepted from this provision.

• Subject to layoff or termination at any time without recourse to the Grievance Procedure;

• No entitlement to benefit coverage; i.e., holidays, funeral, health and welfare/pension, etc.

• Union security check-off procedures would be applicable as defined in the collective Agreement between the parties.

• Would be offered job vacancies before new hires; and

• If permanent employment status would be attained, all contractural provisions would be initiated from that date and earned (prior to temporary/casual time would not be counted).
