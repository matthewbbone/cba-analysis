Section 7 - Master/Local Addendum Jurisdiction

The Master Agreement shall apply to all plants as specified by Article 1, Section 1, and shall be considered the prevailing document. However, there may be local deviations to the Master Agreement which will be administered on a plant-by-plant basis. Any local provision or modifications for a specific location will be recognized as the governing provision for that location and shall be so specified in the agenda to the Master Agreement. The parties agree that where a need arises to modify the Local Addendum, the National Panel must give approval to reopen negotiations. Thereafter, any understanding reached between the parties will be subject to final approval by the National Panel and minutes issued to all parties concerned. Where there is an agreed upon deviation at a plant location, the local deviation shall control at that location only.

In all other cases, the Master Agreement shall control. The commitment of maintaining a parity relationship between ConAgra Frozen Foods Group and its defined competition will continue to be pursued. The definition of "parity" shall be defined as: having an equality between competitors, including base rates, negotiated fringes, shift premiums, and time paid but not worked; i.e., vacation, holidays, and guaranteed minimum hours.
