During 1980, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2001 and 2003 Negotiations the Company and Union agreed to create a Supplement for the Milan Fabrication Shop, to be included within the Contract Product Food Group Master Agreement. Representatives of the International, Local 650, Local 800, Local 849, Local 700, Local 1200 and Hopes of America, and members of the Company's Management have already agreed to the following issues affecting the Milan Fabrication Shop.

Objective:

To operate a separate stand-alone facility providing the ability to fabricate steel/metal to support manufacturing facility needs as deemed economically feasible.

ARTICLE 3 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE

Section 5. Funeral Leave:

An employee may request, in advance, one (1) non-paid day to attend the funeral of his/her aunt, uncle or step-grandparents and three (3) non-paid days to attend the funeral of his/her grandmother, stepmother, son's wife, or daughter's husband. This time off will not count as missing days missed for disciplinary purposes.

ARTICLE 4 - SENIORITY

Section 1: General

Individuals who were from ConAgra Frozen Foods Plant to assume a position in the Fabrication Shop will continue to accrue seniority at their former facility for a period of forty-five (45) worked days and may return at their option or the Company's, in line with their accrued seniority at any time during the forty-five (45) worked days period. Subsequently, such employees will be privileged to make application for Maintenance Department vacancies back at their former plant facility, in line with provisions of Article 4 Section 1 of the Master Agreement. In the event such employee is hired, the employee will forfeit his/her seniority at the Milan Fabrication Shop and will get a one-time benefit, equal to the difference between the rate of pay and salary held at the time they left their former plant facility in work in the Fabrication Shop.

After the above-mentioned forty-five (45) worked days, a Fabrication Shop employee will no longer accrue seniority at their former facility and must be treated as a new hire if they wish to return to that facility; and an opening exists except as provided under the one-time exception set forth above.

In the event of a layoff within the Fabrication Shop itself, employees will be rated in line with their hire date into the Fabrication shop and shall not be entitled ability to perform the required work.
