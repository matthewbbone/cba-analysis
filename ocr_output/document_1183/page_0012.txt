Section 2 - Time Off for Union Activities

Employees designated by the Local Union will be granted the necessary time off without loss of seniority rights and without pay to attend a labor convention or serve in any other capacity or other official Union business. In submitting application for such leave in accordance with Section 1, the employee will specify the necessary length of time off. The Local Union agrees that in making its request for time off for Union activities, due consideration will be given to the number of employees affected in order that there will be no disruption of the Company's operation due to the lack of available employees.

Section 3 - Union and Supervisory Leaves

A. When an employee requests a leave of absence for the purpose of accepting employment with the Union or Management, a meeting will be held between the Union and the Company to discuss the employee's rights under this Section of the Agreement. A leave shall be granted for a period not to exceed six (6) months. No more than six (6) months' leave shall be approved in a twelve (12) month period. Seniority shall accrue during the leave period should the employee return to a job classification covered by this Agreement within the six (6) month period, with such leave time credited as time worked under the various provisions of this Agreement. An employee who fails to return to full-time employment in a job classification covered by this Agreement at the end of six (6) months shall forfeit all seniority and employment shall be terminated. Benefit coverage may be continued during the leave under existing personal leave benefit continuation provisions.

B. The Company shall be under no obligation to an employee on leave of absence except to return him to work in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If an employee returns to work, he will be returned to the classification, work area, and shift he occupied prior to the leave.
