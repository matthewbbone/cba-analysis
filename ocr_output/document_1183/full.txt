The initial visit shall be approved by the plant Industrial Health Supervisor in advance and may take place at any time after the report of injury is filed.

B. It is specifically understood that an employee who is injured while on duty can be required to provide a certificate from the attending physician, nor shall his seniority be limited.

The Company shall furnish transportation to and from the place of medical treatment when determined necessary by the Industrial Health Supervisor. The employee shall be paid for the balance of the regular shift if unable to return to work.

Section 7 - Restricted Work Program:

A. A restricted work program shall exist for designated employees who have incurred work-related injuries which temporarily prevent them from performing the duties of their normal job assignment. Assignments shall be made based not upon seniority, but in line with disability, as determined by the Company physician (where appropriate and not in conflict with state laws). The Company will make job assignments within the doctor's restrictions. Restricted job assignments shall be made in the following manner:

1. By classification.

2. Supplemental in and out of classification without displacement of employees.

3. Make work.

The Industrial Health Supervisor will monitor the progress of all employees on work restricted jobs. When an employee is placed in the restrictive work program, the employee upon request will be given a copy of the restrictions. A discussion will be held with the employee, the employee's immediate supervisor, and the Industrial Health Supervisor as regard to the work assignment. The Union steward will be advised of the employee's assignment to the restrictive work program no later than the end of that work day, provided the steward is available.
The steward will be updated on the status of the restricted work assignment by the Industrial Health Supervisor upon request.

B. To provide a fair, consistent method for handling employees who incur work-related injuries and who become unable to ultimately return to their regular, normal job. This program must not only address the employee's occupational injury considerations, but also must recognize the need for maintaining operation efficiency and flexibility.

• After an employee suffers a work-related injury.
• The employee will either be working on a restricted duty assignment or will be on a leave of absence receiving Temporary Total Disability (TTD) payments.

• Once a doctor indicates the injured employee has reached "full healing status"; i.e., "you're as good as you are going to get" as far as recovery is concerned ("permanent and stationary" for California).

• The employee must return to his regular job or contractual bid to a job that is open and is within the employee's medical restrictions.

• If the employee cannot do either of the foregoing, he will be placed on layoff status.

• Once placed on layoff status, the employee will be entitled to:
—remain on layoff status for up to two (2) years;
—the employee will receive thirteen (13) weeks of Company-paid group medical insurance and
thirty-nine (39) weeks of employee paid group medical insurance;

— the employee may receive vacation checks by meeting all vacation eligibility requirements;

— while on layoff, the employee will be subject to recall and may be recalled, provided the employee can perform the available job, given his medical/physical limitations.

• Unemployment Compensation (UC) - the Company will not automatically protest, or accept, UC claims from employees involved in this Program. The Company will simply give the UC personnel factual answers to any of their questions and will abide by their decision as to whether the employee receives UC or not.

• If during the two (2) year layoff period an employee presents a medical statement indicating the employee is able to return to work, the Company will not automatically return him to work. The employee will be evaluated by a medical professional selected by the Company.
In the event of a disagreement, refer to Article 14, Section I.

Classifications for each of the above departments shall be referenced in Article 9 of the Master Agreement and shown in the applicable individual local supplements.

Section 3 - Layoff and Recall: Layoffs will be made by shifts on the basis of departmental seniority and classification. The plant operations will be divided into three (3) departments: Processing, Maintenance, and Plant Truck Driver. Departmental lines will not be crossed in effecting forced reductions.

In the event of a layoff of seven (7) work days or less, preference employees will be laid off before new class is affected. Next the junior employee(s) in the affected trade and shift will be laid off.

A waiver sheet will be made available for employees in upgrade classifications who do not wish to be assigned outside their work term. This waiver sheet will be: known by seniority. Such a waiver sheet will remain effective for a minimum of three (3) months.

Layoffs, of (14)h. (8) work days or more, the Company shall observe the principle of departmental seniority provided that the employee's trade, shift and skill is affected in the same process, plant, or function as the layoff. Recall will be in reverse order of the layoff; provided the recalled employee has the ability and skill to perform the available work in an efficient manner; and in accomplishing the recall, the Company shall retransfer employees who in the process of the layoff have been transferred to different jobs or different shifts. Retransfer rights shall expire after eighteen (18) months from the date of layoff. Retransfer rights shall be applicable only to those employees who remain on the active payroll after being displaced in another shift or occupation during the course of a permanent workforce reduction. Such retransfer right will apply
to the reoccupation of the "displaced" employee held immediately prior to his present occupation. If displaced employee shall elect not to exercise their recalled right when the first opportunity exists, they shall forfeit all such recalled rights for future reapplication or recall rights that may be granted in a similar order.

In the case of an indefinite layoff in any department, the displaced employees may apply for any vacancy for which they are qualified and have the ability to perform in other departments in the plant. Such employee shall be given preference over new hires to fill such vacancy in accordance with their plant seniority. Any such employee who is selected by the Company to fill such a vacancy in another department shall thereafter serve as recalled employee, as so determined for layoff and recall purposes on the basis of the date upon which he filled the vacancy.

Employees on temporary permanent layoff, whose employment status has changed from that of inactive employment to that of inactive employment, shall be subject only to recall to an opening after the job bidding process involving active employees has been completed. Recall shall be accomplished in seniority order.

In recalling a laid-off employee, the Company shall attempt to locate and notify such employee by telephone or failing in that by certified mail at his last known address. In the event the Company is unable to contact a laid-off employee, or if the employee has been contacted and requested to return to work but fails to do so within five (5) calendar days of such request an employment right of such employee may be considered. Failure of an employee to keep the Company informed as to his current address by telephone or certified mail shall relieve the Company of any responsibility to recall a laid-off employee.

Section 5 - Job Bidding: When a permanent vacancy occurs within the Processing Department, a notice of such vacancy shall be posted on or before the fourth (4th) working day following the day the vacancy becomes known to the Company if vacancy is to be filled. In cases of retirement, or where an employee gives advance notice of their intent to vacate a position, a notice of such decision must be posted not more than ten (10) days prior at the earliest and on each work day. Such notice shall be posted for a period of three (3) working days and any employee in the department in which the vacancy has occurred desiring to submit a bid for such vacancy must do so in writing within such three (3) day period. The senior employee who bids for such vacancy shall be assigned thereto within ten (10) working days thereafter, provided that the successful bidder is capable of performing the job according to the requirements and in comparison to other employees performing the same job and is capable of learning to satisfactorily perform the job.

Selection of employees to fill Lead Quality Control, Cook 3 and Shipping and Receiving Lead/Chk
classifications shall be based on an interview, qualifications, and seniority. In the event of equally qualified employees, seniority shall prevail. The same reward, if available, on the shift interviewed shall be present during the interviews. Lead will be required to become HACCP certified.

As far as training opportunities for Lead, Quality Control Cook, and Shipping and Receiving Lead/Cook positions are concerned, an interest sheet will be provided informing employees of the position and duties. Employees signing the sheet will indicate their interest to train for the position. The most senior employee within the work area signing the interest sheet will be utilized to relieve for vacations, absences or leaves of absence for training purposes.

1) Selection Process (name)

2) Training

A: Interest sheets (name)

B: Train only two (2) employees from interest sheets by utilizing them to fill temporary vacancies

C: If a new senior employee bids into the area, he/she will be able to sign the interest sheet upon request and therefore be trained. However, training will only occur when one of the two employees who have been trained leave that work area.

D: Training will occur within a ninety (90) day time frame

E: Only one (1) employee will be trained at a time

The Company shall furnish a copy of the bid posting and the letter to the Union and will indicate on the posting the employee/employees utilized for the bid.

In posting vacancies, the location of the vacancy will be shown on the bid sheet only for the jobs identified by asterisk as shown on the wage rate schedule. Whenever applicable, or the vacancies will be identified on the bid sheet by department as agreed to by the Union and the Company.

In addition to the other rules governing the bidding of permanent vacancies, the following rules shall apply:

1) When an initial permanent vacancy is filled by a successful bid replacement bidding will continue until the third entry level opening exists.
The third (entry-level) opening is subject to bid only by employee from another shift who have not successfully bid in the last six (6) months.

2) A successful bidder shall not be entitled to bid another job for six (6) months, unless his/her job is eliminated or he has an opportunity to bid on a job with a higher rate of pay, or to another shift.
3. No employee shall be permitted to bid until such employee has passed his/her probationary period. If an eligible, qualified person fails to return the preliminary employment express interest in the job will be considered for such vacancy.

4. The senior employee who is unvoted on a job bid shall have up to five (5) days to qualify for each opening. After the employee is deemed qualified, a replacement bid will be posted. This five (5) day period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. If the employee has previously held the bid job within the last two (2) years, the five (5) day qualification period does not apply.

5. In this event such employee's seniority would return to his/her previous rank and shift.

6. The next senior person would be assigned from the original bid sheet and would begin on up to five (5) days to qualify.

7. When a successful bidder is awarded a job, then during the trial period elect to return to their previous jobs, he/she will be restricted from additional bidding for a period of four (4) months from the date the job was awarded. Employees shall not be permitted to bid in any other classification for four (4) months. Employee will be permitted to bid on a job with a higher rate of pay in a different classification.

8. If the vacancy is not filled under this provision outlined above, it will be offered to the senior qualified bidder on the seniority list.

9. As per Company policy, if a vacancy caused by quit, discharge, transfer, retirement or establishment of a new job is permanent and shall be further defined as a vacancy which will be posted for job bidding after all active displaced employees who hold "transfer" rights to this opening have first been solicited in seniority order.

JOB DISQUALIFICATION

1. In the event an employee can no longer perform his job, or when proven unable to fulfill his duties, on classified jobs the following rules shall apply:

2. When the Company recognizes an employee is not performing his job as expected, they will meet with the employee in the presence of a Union Steward to discuss job performance.

A- bump the junior entry-level permanent person on his shift; or

B- bump the junior entry-level permanent person on another shift; or

C- be laid off.

Persons already disqualified will bump junior entry-level of same job type (i.e. "permanent" line service).

3) The employee shall not be permitted to bid that job classification for nine (9) months.

Section 6.- Temporary Vacancy: In case of any temporary vacancy, resulting from absence, leave of absence, vacation or an emergency such vacancy will be filled as follows:

1. All permanent employees will be given the opportunity to sign an interest sheet to be placed on two upgrade jobs within their own work area and shift on a seniority basis. Upgrade jobs are defined as those job above entry level rate of pay. To be eligible to sign an interest sheet, the job must be at the same or higher rate of pay than the employee's current position.

2. When such vacancy occurs in the "apprentice" classified positions (i.e., Dummy Mixer, day shift), the seniority qualified person in the day shift will fill-in until he is replaced.

B. the least senior available entry-level in another work area.

745 In the event of a job elimination, an employee will be permitted to bid desire, to fill their name, in accordance with their seniority onto the interest sheet for the job classification from which he/she was eliminated. This provision will provide that displaced employees an opportunity to work in higher "old" job classification on a temporary vacancy basis.

4) In case such vacancy exceeds fourteen (14) working days, the vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of this Article; provided, however, that a vacancy occasioned by sickness, vacation or leave of absence shall not be subject to bid.

Section 7.- Processing Department: In the event it becomes necessary to transfer employees out of their work area due to a reduced production schedule, the Company will make every effort to transfer the least senior employee. Tenants resulting from the shutdown or line breakdowns during a work day would
be exempt from this procedure; however, such transition from the line will be accomplished by seniority.
