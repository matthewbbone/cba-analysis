*For employees hired after 3-18-91, a calendar day schedule will be used as follows: 6 months is replaced with 180 calendar days; 12 months is replaced with 360 calendar days; and 18-months is replaced with 540 calendar days. Actual increases will be paid commensurate with the "last-day" of the pay period immediately following the above effective dates.

Example: I find in $7.65 + .20 at 180 days = $7.85; + .20 at 360 days = $8.05, difference is Rate at 340 days.
