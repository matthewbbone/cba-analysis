ARTICLE 5 - MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS

Section 1 - Maintenance of Standards

The Company agrees that all conditions of employment not specified in this Agreement relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials, and general working conditions shall be maintained at not less than the highest minimum standard in effect prior to the signing of this Agreement. The conditions of employment shall be improved wherever specific provisions for improvement are made elsewhere in this Agreement.

If the Company shall dispute the existence of any alleged standard, the matter shall be referred directly to Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure and shall be processed through the remaining steps until a decision is reached.

Any standard initiated by the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement over and above those standards required under the provisions of this Agreement will be required to be maintained thereafter, if such standard is kept in effect for a period of ninety (90) days after its initiation.

Section 2 - Extra Contract Agreements

The Company agrees not to enter into any other Agreement or contract with its employees, individually or collectively, which in any way conflicts with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

The Company is permitted to make and enforce any reasonable Company rules by mutual agreement with the Union which do not conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. If unable to agree on such rules, they shall be submitted to the Grievance Procedure as established by this Agreement. All such rules shall be posted for a period of six (6) days before becoming effective and the Union shall be furnished a copy of such rules.
