is no steward on duty, an employee is to be used in place of a steward.

Union stewards have no authority to take strike action or any other action interrupting the Company's business, except as authorized by official action of the Union.
The Company recognizes these limitations upon the authority of Union stewards and shall not hold the Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Company in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper discipline, including discharge, in the event the Union steward has taken unauthorized strike action, slow down, or work stoppage in violation of this Agreement; except the Union steward may use Article 7 to challenge whether he so took any such unauthorized action.

ARTICLE 3 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE

Section 1 - Granting of Consent

A. All personal leaves of absence without pay of one (1) week or more may be granted for good and sufficient reasons, provided the employee makes a written request to and has permission granted in writing from the Plant Manager or his designee. Requests must be submitted at least three (3) working days prior to the requested starting date of the leave. In emergency requests for leaves of absence, the Company must be notified within 24 hours of failure to report to work. For personal leaves of absence (without pay), except disability leaves, the Company will notify the Local Union office.

B. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Section shall result in the complete loss of seniority rights and job of the employee involved. Any employee using a leave of absence as a subterfuge shall forfeit his seniority rights and job. An employee shall not accept employment elsewhere when on leave of absence without Company approval. The Company will notify the Local Union office.
