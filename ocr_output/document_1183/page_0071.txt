5. Exercise against the least senior entry level, based upon the employee's Preference Sheet (on the opposite shift); or

6. Move to the Extra Board pursuant to Item 5 of the Extra Board Agreement.

Preference Sheets will give employees the preference of selecting, in advance, the entry level job classification and shift in which they wish to be placed, based upon seniority, in the event of a Permanent Layoff:

1. Every employee will have the opportunity of signing a Permanent Layoff Preference Sheet;

2. Any employee will have the opportunity to change his/her Preference Sheet by reporting to the Human Resources office; and executing their desired change.

3. No change to a Preference Sheet will be permitted after a Layoff Notice has been posted in the Plant.

4. If an employee fails to report for a permanent layoff, or is unable to hold out entry level positions based upon his preference sheet, such displaced employee will be assigned to the Extra Board.

The Company shall recall laid-off employees in the reverse order of their layoff, and in accomplishing the recall, shall retransfer employees who, in the process of the layoff, have been transferred to different jobs or different shifts. Re-transfer rights shall expire after 60 days from the date of layoff. Re-transfer rights shall be applicable only if an employee has remained on the active payroll, after being diagnosed as "reenter" staff classification, or after having the course of a permanent work force reduction! Such retransfer rights shall apply in the classification, shift, or area to which displaced employee held immediately prior to his present classification. If displaced employees shall elect not to exercise their retransfer rights to their shift classification, and were when the first opportunity exists, they shall forfeit such retransfer right for future use.

Recall shall be accomplished in seniority order.

In recalling laid-off employees, the Company shall endeavor to contact each such employee by telephone or, failing that, by certified mail at their last known address. In the event the Company is unable to contact a laid-off employee or in the event an employee
