Section 7 - Restricted Work Program:

A. A restricted work program shall exist for designated employees who have incurred work-related injuries which temporarily prevent them from performing the duties of their normal job assignment. Assignments shall be made based not upon seniority, but in line with disability, as determined by the Company physician (where appropriate and not in conflict with state laws). The Company will make job assignments within the doctor's restrictions. Restricted job assignments shall be made in the following manner:

1. By classification.

2. Supplemental in and out of classification without displacement of employees.

3. Make work.

The Industrial Health Supervisor will monitor the progress of all employees on work restricted jobs. When an employee is placed in the restrictive work program, the employee upon request will be given a copy of the restrictions. A discussion will be held with the employee, the employee's immediate supervisor, and the Industrial Health Supervisor as regard to the work assignment. The Union steward will be advised of the employee's assignment to the restrictive work program no later than the end of that work day, provided the steward is available.
