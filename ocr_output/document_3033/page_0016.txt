Notwithstanding the above, for the purposes of this Section, Deputies who attended Academy Classes which began between September 25, 1997 and April 25, 1999, formerly known as "Modified" Academy Training Classes, who qualify for the Basic POST Certificate Bonus shall be entitled to the thirty-eight (38) or (50) fifty standard salary "levels" for the Intermediate or Advance POST certificate provided the employee successfully meets the POST requirements for time in service and education/training points.

The date on which training is completed, or the date of issue on said Certificate shall be the effective date for the award of the bonus for payroll purposes, except when new employees possess a POST Certificate upon employment, then the date for the award of the bonus shall be the date of employment.

In no event shall an employee be compensated under this Section for any period of time such employee held a POST Certificate prior to September 1, 1985. The bonuses shall be considered as wages, and, upon promotions, employees shall be placed on a step in the new salary schedule which provides an increase in salary consistent with the provisions of Section 6.08.090 of the Los Angeles County Code. Employees who do not qualify for the Basic POST bonus as set forth above, shall remain eligible for the twenty-six (26) standard salary "level" bonus by certifying to the Sheriff every six (6) months following July 1, 1979, that steps are being taken (training or education, not experience) to achieve the Basic POST Certificate.
