The test subject will be provided two LASD or Bureau approved specimen bottles (samples A and B). The containers will have affixed to them specially prepared labels showing the test subject's confidential identification number. The subject's right thumb print will be rolled onto the labels by the Collection Site Supervisor. The subject shall then be ordered to provide a urine specimen and to divide it equally between the two bottles in the presence of the Collection Site Supervisor.

A minimum of 50 milliliters (1.7 fluid ounces) must be provided or the specimen will be considered incomplete. If the Collection Site Supervisor determines that there is an insufficient amount of urine (less than 50 milliliters total) in the specimen bottles, additional urine shall be collected. In this instance, the test subject shall remain under the supervision of the Collection Site Supervisor. The subject shall be asked to drink fluids to aid in urination and shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to furnish additional urine. When additional specimens are provided, third and fourth bottles shall be labeled, be affixed with another thumbprint label and be fastened to the original specimen bottles with clear tape Immediately after a specimen collection, the Collection Site Supervisor shall ensure the temperature is between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The Collection Site Supervisor shall also inspect the specimen for signs of adulteration (e.g., contaminants, color, etc.). Unusual findings should be noted in the remarks section of the Collection Log Sheet.
