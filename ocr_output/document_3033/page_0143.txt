DEPUTY SHERIFF IV

Assignments/Placement

The Classification of Deputy IV will remain a class until it is phased out through attrition. Since Deputy IV's will continue to be paid the same as Bonus I Deputies, it is incumbent upon the Department to eventually place all Deputy IV's on Bonus positions.

Priority shall be given to Deputy IV's for assignment to Bonus positions as they become vacant through natural attrition. Failure to place Deputy IV's will result in excessive cost and delays in the process of alignment.

This placement of Deputy IV's shall not cause the removal of Deputy personnel currently assigned to Bonus positions. The procedure shall be to fill the position with an available, qualified Deputy IV when the position becomes vacant.

Deputy Sheriff IV - Voluntary Demotion

A Deputy IV who is assigned to a Bonus Level position may voluntarily transfer to a Generalist Non-Bonus position by using the current voluntary reduction process. Since the classification of Deputy IV is being eliminated by attrition, a Deputy IV that voluntarily reduces a rank will not have restoration rights as the item will automatically convert to a Bonus item once the item is vacated.
