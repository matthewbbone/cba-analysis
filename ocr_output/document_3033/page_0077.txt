E. Collection, Integrity and Identification of Specimen

After a test subject has been properly identified, briefed about the reason for the test and has completed the Pre-test Declaration form, the mechanics of the collection process shall be explained. The Collection Site Supervisor shall require the test subject to remove any unnecessary outer garment (e.g., coats, jackets, etc.) and shall visually check for signs of concealed items that might be used to adulterate or substitute a sample. Personal belongings such as briefcases, purses, and weapons/holsters, etc., must remain with the subject's other outer garments. The subject shall retain control of his/her wallet.

The test subject shall wash and dry his/her hands prior to providing a urine specimen. There shall be no further access to water, soap, any chemical agent, or other materials which would be used to adulterate the specimen until after it has been provided.

The Collection Site Supervisor shall place a toilet bluing agent in the toilet bowl and, if the toilet is so equipped, in the reservoir tank. The purpose of this procedure is to deter the dilution of the specimen.

The test subject shall be required to provide a specimen in a large, wide mouthed, easily carried, plastic non-reusable cup, unobserved and in the privacy of a stall or otherwise partitioned area. Unusual behavior shall be noted by the Collection Site Supervisor on the Collection Log Sheet.
