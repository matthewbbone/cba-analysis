on the Collection Log Sheet serving as the chain of custody document (Attachment B). Any evidence of any tampering, or discrepancies in the identification numbers on the samples and Collection Log Sheet, or in the event that the seal is broken on either sample, that there is no identification number, or the ID number is illegible, or that a thumbprint is missing or illegible on either sample, such shall be reported to the Drug Abuse Program Director and shall be noted on the Collection Log Sheet. Such specimens shall not be tested. (However, such specimen may be recollected.) All other samples will then be stored at the Laboratory.

C. Specimen Processing

Laboratory personnel will normally process urine specimens (sample A) by grouping them into batches. When conducting the screening test, every batch shall contain an appropriate number of standards for calibrating the instrumentation and a minimum of 10 percent controls.

Initial Screening Test
Current NIDA/SAMHSA standards in affect at the time of collection, and, for those drugs without a NIDA/SAMHSA standard, Attachment "C" shall be used for the immunoassay screening test which will be used to eliminate "negative" urine samples from further consideration. Detailed screening and quality assurance procedures are discussed in the Laboratory Procedural Manual.
