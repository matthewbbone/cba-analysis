C. Employee Notification

If the MRO does not find appropriate medical justification for the positive laboratory findings, he/she shall prepare a written report to the Program Director. Upon notification to the employee of a positive finding, the employee shall be provided with the laboratory report (as described in part V, F. above) and the MRO's written report. The Employee also shall be provided with a written notice of his or her right to have the second sample (Sample B) independently tested and reviewed by an independent MRO.

D. Retesting

When the Laboratory has confirmed a positive test result, the Employee or his/her representative may request that a GC/MS test of Specimen B be conducted at an independent lab (refer to Appendix A for a list of laboratories).

If the test results are positive, an independent Medical Review Officer selected by the employee or his/her representative will review the findings and interview the employee (at his/her option). The MRO will prepare an advisory report to be given to the Drug Abuse Program Director with a copy to the employee. Internal Affairs and the employee will be notified by the Program Director. A pre-disciplinary hearing (Skelly) may take place as a result of the investigation.

If the results of the first independent lab are negative, The Drug Abuse Program Director may request that GC/MS test of Specimens A and B be performed at a second independent lab (refer to Appendix A for the list of the laboratories).
