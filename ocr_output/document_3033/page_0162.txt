position and to indicate the individual to be a hazard/detriment to himself/herself, other individuals or to the Department should he/she continue in the position.

E. Position (Job) status change.
    1. Budget elimination of the job.
        It is not only intended but mandatory as a part of this Bonus system that there be no situation in which the Bonus money is removed and the job remain. Any budget reductions must impact a job in its entirety and not the Bonus as a separate entity.

    2. Realignment/reallocation of the job.
        Any realignment/reallocation of Bonus positions shall be made at the Division level. These changes may result from staffing pattern changes, contract increases or decreases, etc. It is intended that realignment be determined at the Division level to ensure consistency of rationale and approach.

F. Job limitations and duration.
    It is anticipated that certain jobs may have automatic limitations and durations of assignment. For example, a Patrol Training Officer will receive the Bonus only so long as he/she has a trainee and to a maximum of six months per individual trainee. After six months, should the trainee need further training he/she shall be assigned to another Training Officer.
