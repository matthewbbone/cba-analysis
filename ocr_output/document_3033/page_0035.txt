C. Incumbent Employees

1. When this program requiring an Incumbent Employee to transfer from a Covered Unit to another unit of assignment goes into effect:

a. The beginning of the Limited Term Assignment shall commence on the date this program becomes effective.

b. He/she shall, within ten (10) days from the date this program becomes effective, be notified in writing that his/her Tour of Duty shall not exceed that specified in Section B. herein.

c. He/she shall receive not less than twelve (12) months, nor more than fifteen (15) months advance written notice as to the date on which his/her Tour of Duty shall expire.

2. All Incumbent Employees shall, upon their transfer from a Covered Unit, continue to receive bonus pay as well as all future negotiated raises and applicable step raises as if they remained in that position in the Covered Unit. The intent of this provision is to ensure that the Incumbent Employee shall not suffer any form of economic loss as a result of the implementation of this program.
