ARTICLE 21    LEGAL REPRESENTATION

Upon request of an employee and subject to any limitations provided by law, County will provide for the defense of any civil action or proceeding initiated against the employee by a person or entity other than County in a court of competent jurisdiction, on account of any act or omission occurring within the course and scope of his/her employment as an employee of County.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the provision of such defense where the discretion to provide or not provide such defense is vested in County pursuant to the provisions of the California Government Code, or where the act or omission was not within the scope of the employee's employment, or the employee acted or failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption or actual malice, or where the provision of such defense would create a conflict of interest between County and the employee.

Nothing herein shall be construed to grant to any employee any rights or privileges in addition to those provided in said Government Code.
