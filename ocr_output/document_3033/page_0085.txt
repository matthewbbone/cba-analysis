If the test results from the second independent lab are negative, or if the Program Director elects not to have a second independent chemical test, no further action will be taken.

If the test results from the second independent lab are positive, an independent Medical Review Officer will review the findings and interview the employee (at his/her option). The MRO will prepare an advisory report to be given to the Drug Abuse Program Director with a copy to the employee. Internal Affairs and the employee will be notified by the Program Director. A pre-disciplinary hearing (Skelly) may take place as a result of the investigation. The results of the third analysis (samples A and B) shall be deemed conclusive.

The LASD or the Bureau shall pay for all such retesting.

However, results of drug tests not obtained within the specifications of the Drug Testing Program and not processed by a laboratory mutually agreed to by the union and management shall not be considered.

E. Referrals by the Medical Review Officer Not a Bar to Disciplinary Action

The Medical Review Officer may counsel the subject regarding follow-up care by competent medical authority and, if requested, furnish referrals.
