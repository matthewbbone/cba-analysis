ARTICLE 9    CALL BACK

Whenever an employee is unexpectedly ordered by his Department Head or designated management representative to return to work following the termination of his/her normal work shift and departure from his/her work location, the employee shall receive a payment of four hours' pay at the rate of time and one-half of the employee's regular rate of pay. Work performed in excess of four hours will be compensated for in accordance with provisions of Article 8, Hours of Work and Overtime.

If an employee should complete work required, leave the work location, and subsequently be recalled during the four-hour period being compensated for as a result of the initial call back, no additional compensation will be paid until four hours have been worked by the employee; i.e., there shall be no pyramiding of time and one-half pay as a result of call back.

If an employee's work schedule must be altered to accommodate operational requirements on any scheduled work day and the employee is required to report or work up to two hours earlier than his/her normal shift starting time, this shall be considered an early shift start and not a call back. Employees assigned to an early shift start will be allowed to work to the end of their normal shift provided work is available in their classification.
