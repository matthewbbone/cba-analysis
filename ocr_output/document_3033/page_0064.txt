ARTICLE 28    RANDOM DRUG TESTING PROGRAM

Section 1    Introduction

A. Statement of Policy

Law enforcement officers are called upon to make a number of decisions. Among them is sometimes deciding whether or not to use deadly force in the discharge of their duties. They are required to function in environments that are often hostile, hazardous and sometimes corrupt. Few persons are given such sensitive public trust.

Any illegal use of drugs by law enforcement officers would pose a serious threat to public safety. It would negatively affect morale and safety in the workplace, endanger credible testimony, and significantly increase the risk of incurring civil liability.

In the interests of the County of Los Angeles, its citizens, and the members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (hereinafter LASD) and the District Attorney's Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter Bureau), it shall be the policy of the LASD and Bureau to implement a random drug testing program.

All aspects of this drug testing program shall be on County time and paid consistent with the provisions of this MOU.
