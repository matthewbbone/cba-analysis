Section 2.    Bulletin Boards

Management agrees to provide at least one arch-file clipboard for the exclusive use of ALADS in each area or facility employing more than ten (10) employees. ALADS shall have the right to use such arch-file clipboard to post information or material concerning the following subjects:

A. ALADS recreational, social and related news bulletins;
B. Scheduled ALADS meetings;
C. Information concerning ALADS elections or the results thereof;
