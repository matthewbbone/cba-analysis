whether or not the relief person continues to perform the Bonus job. The relief personnel would not be considered as regular Bonus personnel beyond one quarter, unless formally appointed as regular.

It shall be the responsibility of the Unit Commander to ensure that personnel assigned as temporary relief for Bonus positions do not exceed this 20-day limit. Should the individual be assigned in excess of 20 working days within a three-month increment to a Bonus position, the Unit Commander shall process a Bonus Pay Authorization through proper channels. The box "other" shall indicate that the individual exceeded the 20-day limit.

Relief for Long Term Sick or Injured Personnel

Individuals who are assigned to Bonus level positions as relief for long term sick or injured personnel (long term = off or unable to perform the job for 30 days or more) shall be authorized to receive Bonus payment. The same three-month increment assignment rule applies to the appointment of relief personnel and therefore an overlap payment period will exist where it is necessary to fill in behind sick or injured personnel. It is, however, intended that relief personnel be appointed with the understanding that at the end of the three months they are subject to automatic removal. Unit Commanders shall inform the individuals selected, in writing, of their status of "temporary relief". The procedures for notification processes for selection and Bonus pay authorization shall be the same as those for regular Bonuses.
