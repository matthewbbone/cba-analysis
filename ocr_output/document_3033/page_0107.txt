Section 4. Informal Procedures

Most problems or complaints can be settled if the employee will promptly, informally and amicably discuss them with his/her immediate supervisor. This desired initial discussion, a part of the day-to-day supervision, should ideally precede any use of the formal grievance procedure.

Within ten (10) business days from the occurrence of the matter on which a complaint is based, or within ten (10) business days from his/her knowledge of such occurrence, an employee shall either discuss the complaint with his/her immediate supervisor or file a formal grievance.

NOTE: In those situations where the nature of the problem involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may discuss the problem informally with the next level supervisor although he/she should generally advise the immediate supervisor of his/her intention.

If the immediate supervisor either fails to reply within three (3) business days or gives an answer which the employee feels is unsatisfactory, within five (5) business days, the employee may informally discuss the grievance with his/her second level supervisor or proceed with the formal grievance procedure.

If the second level supervisor either fails to reply to the employee within three (3) business days or gives an answer which the employee feels is unsatisfactory, the employee may then initiate the formal grievance procedure at the third level of supervision.
