Section 5. Formal Procedure

First Step (Third Level Supervisor or Designated Middle Management Representative)

If the problem has not been resolved within eleven (11) business days of the date of the initial discussion with the first level supervisor (or ten (10) business days from the occurrence or knowledge of the occurrence of a grievable matter if no informal discussion has occurred), the employee may file a formal written grievance with his/her third level supervisor or middle management representative. The Department Grievance Form (SH-AD-465) shall be completed by the employee describing the problem and the remedy he/she believes is merited.

The third level supervisor or middle management representative shall promptly notify Sheriff's Employee Relations. The third level supervisor or middle management representative shall consider available pertinent information and give his/her decision in writing (original SH-AD-465) to the employee within five (5) business days. The supervisor shall include the reasons for his/her decision and forward a complete copy of SH-AD-465 to Sheriff's Employee Relations.

If, upon receipt of the decision, the employee takes no further action within ten (10) business days, the grievance will be assumed to have been settled.

If the supervisor has not answered the employee's complaint within five (5) business days or if the answer is unsatisfactory in the employee's opinion, the employee may appeal to the next grievance level.
