Effective November 1, 1997, all persons employed in the classifications of Deputy Sheriff shall have their step converted from a six-step salary range to an eight-step salary range as follows:

    From Step 1 to Step 3
    From Step 2 to Step 4
    From Step 3 to Step 5
    From Step 4 to Step 6
    From Step 5 to Step 7
    From Step 6 to Step 8

Criteria for Salary Step 8

The eighth step of the Deputy Sheriff pay scale shall be authorized after completion of one year on the seventh step; completion of Custody and Patrol assignments with competent performance evaluations; and successful completion of Custody and Patrol training programs.

If an individual's performance is less than competent in either assignment or in either training program, the eighth step will not be authorized. The individual will be limited to the seventh step of the salary range. Deputies may transfer to any other assignment where acceptable, but shall not be paid above the seventh step of the salary range. This does not preclude the appointment of these individuals to certain Bonus positions in future assignments.
