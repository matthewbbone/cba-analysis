NOTIFICATION OF APPLICATION AND VACANCIES IN BONUS POSITIONS

Competition for the assignment to a Bonus position is the dual responsibility of the individual and the Department. Individuals must be motivated to actively seek out a Bonus position for which they are qualified. The Department has the responsibility of notifying its personnel as to what positions are Bonus positions and who should be contacted in order to file an application.

To accomplish this, Personnel Administration shall biannually (each January and July) initiate a Sheriff's Department broadcast to all personnel which will:

1. Remind all personnel of the existence of the Bonus Selection Standards Manual.

2. List all existing Bonus positions.

3. Give the title of the person and phone number within the individual units who has the necessary information about vacancies and application and selection procedures.
