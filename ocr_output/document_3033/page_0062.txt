ARTICLE 26    MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

It is the exclusive right of the County to determine the mission of each of its constituent departments, boards, and commissions, set standards of service to be offered to the public, and exercise control and discretion over its organization and operations. It is also the exclusive right of the County to direct its employees, take disciplinary action for proper cause, relieve its employees from duty, effect work furloughs or any other alternatives because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons, and determine the methods, means and personnel by which the County's operations are to be conducted; provided, however, that the exercise of such rights does not preclude employees or their representatives from conferring or raising grievances about the practical consequences that decisions on these matters may have on wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.
