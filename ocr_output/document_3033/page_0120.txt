Section 7    Formal Procedure

Step 1. (Immediate Supervisor)

If the problem has not been resolved within ten (10) business days of the date of the initial discussion with the immediate supervisor (or ten (10) business days from the occurrence or knowledge of the occurrence of a grievable matter if no informal discussion has occurred), the employee may file a formal written grievance with his/her immediate supervisor. The Grievance Form shall be prepared in triplicate by the employee stating the specific nature of the grievance and the remedy requested. The employee shall submit the original and one copy of the Grievance Form to his/her immediate supervisor and retain a copy. The Grievance Form may be secured from the departmental Personnel Section or from ALADS. Upon receipt of the formal grievance the immediate supervisor shall contact the grievant or the grievant's representative (if specified) and arrange a hearing date and location. Within five (5) business days from the completion of the hearing the Grievance Response Form shall be completed by the immediate supervisor. The original of both the Grievance Response forms shall be returned to the grievant and a copy of the Grievance Response Form shall be retained by the immediate supervisor.

If the grievance is within the scope of the immediate supervisor's authority and responsibility and it is sustained, it shall be the immediate supervisor's responsibility to make the necessary arrangements to implement the decision.
