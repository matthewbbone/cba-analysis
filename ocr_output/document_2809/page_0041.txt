Section 7: RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFIT FUND

A. The Retiree Medical Benefit Fund for unit members in the Paraeducator bargaining unit in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Contract shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of this Contract except that effective October 1, 1997 and each year thereafter the District shall deposit to this fund an amount equal to the prior year's deposit, increased by the same percentage by which the salary schedule is increased as set forth in Article 7, Section 1, less advance deposits, if any, as described in Paragraph F below. This fund shall be used exclusively to reduce the monthly contributions paid by eligible retirees participating in a district-sponsored group medical plan by the amount established by Paragraph E.

B. Effective October 1, 1997, the deposit to the fund shall be sixty-four thousand and twelve dollars ($64,012) annually adjusted by general salary increases. The deposit shall form the new base annual deposit for the fund pursuant to Section 7.A. above.

C. A retiree who meets all of the following conditions will be eligible for this benefit:

1. The unit member, immediately upon separation from the District, began to receive a disability or service retirement benefit from the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or the State Teachers' Retirement System (STRS).

2. The unit member had seventeen (17) years of paid monthly salaried service with the District (excluding unpaid leaves of absence).

3. The unit member's retirement effective date with PERS or STRS is on or after June 1, 1988.

4. The unit member is under age sixty-seven (67) as of the retirement effective date with PERS or STRS except that retirees age sixty-five (65) and over whose retirement effective date occurred after June 30, 1998, shall be required to enroll in/purchase both Parts A and B of Medicare to continue in this program.

5. The unit member was covered under a district-sponsored group medical plan as a unit member immediately prior to the retirement effective date under PERS or STRS and chose to maintain coverage under such plan as a retiree by executing the appropriate form and making the required contribution to the District.

D. Eligibility for this benefit shall cease at the end of the month in which the retiree dies, reaches age, sixty-seven (67) or ceases to make the required contributions, whichever occurs first. The retiree may continue coverage in the district-sponsored medical plan beyond age sixty-seven (67) by contributing the full cost of coverage to the District. All other provisions of the group medical plans shall remain in effect.

E. Annually, a new reduction in the monthly contribution shall be established by dividing the total amount of money in the fund (after the deposit made in accordance with Paragraph F) by the expected number of eligible retirees, divided by twelve (12). Effective May 1, 1998, such amount shall not exceed one-hundred and twenty-five dollars ($125) monthly. Effective January 1, 1999, such amount shall not exceed one hundred and thirty-five dollars ($135) monthly. Effective July 1, 1999, such amount shall not exceed one hundred and thirty-five dollars ($135) monthly for retirees with single coverage or one hundred and forty-five dollars ($145) for retirees covering eligible dependents. Effective January 1, 2000, such amount shall not exceed one hundred and forty-five ($145) monthly for retirees with single coverage or one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) monthly
