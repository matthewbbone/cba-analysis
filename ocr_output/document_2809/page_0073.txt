A hearing officer will begin the hearing within fifteen (15) workdays from the day a written request for hearing and a written answer to the charges is received by the Board of Education. The hearing date may be continued for one (1) time at the request of the district or the unit member with the approval of the hearing officer upon the showing of good cause. Additional continuances may be obtained by mutual agreement of the parties involved.

Equal opportunity will be afforded the Board of Education and the unit member to present evidence. The findings of the hearing officer will be rendered in writing to the unit member and the Board of Education within seven (7) workdays after the hearing is closed. The decision of the hearing officer in each case is final and effective on the date when rendered.

Section 10: LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF HEARINGS

Wherever this Article requires that an unit member be furnished with written papers of any kind, such requirements will be deemed to have been satisfied if an envelope containing such written papers has been deposited in certified mail addressed to the unit member at the last address of official record with the district within the time specified in the particular Section of this Article.
