ARTICLE 24. SUBCONTRACTING AND DONATED SERVICES

Section 1: CONTRACTING OUT/SUBCONTRACTING

It is understood that the contracting out or subcontracting of work shall not result in the layoff or reduction of bargaining unit members or positions, nor shall it diminish the rights provided to laid off unit members under the provisions of Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment.

Section 2: DONATION OF WORK

The intent of this Section is not to supplant the work of the bargaining unit by accepting donated work, but to recognize the need for donated work due to lack of available personnel and/or resources.

The District may accept the donation of work providing that it does not result in the layoff, reduction, or replacement of bargaining unit employees or positions. The District agrees not to advertise for donated work.

Section 3: PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS

The District may continue to participate in programs sponsored by local, state and federal agencies as a public service to the community, providing that such programs do not result in the layoff or reduction in work year/work hours of Bargaining Unit Members or positions.
