ARTICLE 8. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT

Section 1: WORKDAY AND WORKWEEK

A. The District recognizes the principle of an eight (8) hour workday and a forty (40) hour workweek for unit members employed on a full-time basis. The traditional workweek shall be Monday through Friday. For payroll accounting purposes, the traditional workweek begins on Monday at 12:00 a.m. and ends on the following Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Normally, the workweek shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays and two (2) consecutive days off. The non-traditional workweek shall not exceed five (5) consecutive workdays starting any day other than a Monday.

B. The District shall designate the length of the workday and workweek subject to other applicable provisions in this Contract. Each unit member shall be assigned a regular, ascertainable number of hours per week.

C. Unit members working in Outdoor Education may be allowed to work a flexible forty (40) hour workweek schedule, not necessarily limited to the typical eight (8) hour per day shift. The site administrator shall determine flexible schedules after granting the affected unit members the opportunity to provide input.

Section 2: WORK SCHEDULE

A. The unit member’s supervisor shall establish the unit member’s work schedule at the time of initial employment. A change in the work schedule is defined as the modification of a unit member’s starting and/or ending time of a workday. The work schedule may be changed under the following circumstances:

1. When mutually agreed to by the unit member and the supervisor.

2. When a unit member is given a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days written notice prior to the effective date of a permanent change in work schedule, or five (5) workdays written notice for a temporary change in work schedule.

B. In the event of an emergency the supervisor may modify/change the work schedule.

C. The unit member’s supervisor will discuss, with the unit member, any problems affecting the implementation of work schedule changes.

D. Unit members may be temporarily exempt from a permanent change in work schedule providing the unit member verifies enrollment in a course in an institution of higher education or verifies childcare issues which conflict with the proposed work schedule change and which cannot be rescheduled at a time compatible with the proposed work schedule.

E. A unit member’s work schedule shall not be changed temporarily to avoid the payment of split shift or night shift differentials.
