ARTICLE 12. LEAVE POLICIES
Section 19.E.1. (continued)

c. Unit members may receive only one credit of forty (40) days in any fiscal year. Any unit member who has accessed forty (40) days in any one (1) fiscal year shall not be approved for additional withdrawals from the bank in a subsequent fiscal year until all other pending applications have been processed.

2. Days granted but not used will be returned to the Bank. Unit members will be compensated at their daily rate of pay for each Catastrophic Leave Bank day used.

3. Unit members receiving compensation under Worker’s Compensation provisions shall not be eligible to withdraw days from the Catastrophic Leave Bank until exhausting all such benefits.

4. A unit member whose application for paid catastrophic leave is denied may request that the decision be reviewed by the Contract Administration Committee (CAC). The CAC shall ensure that all information contained in the review remains confidential and that the provisions of this Section were appropriately applied in evaluating the unit member’s application. The CAC’s decision shall be final and binding.

5. Days from the leave bank shall be authorized on a first-come, first-served basis. In the event the Bank is depleted, no further applications to use paid catastrophic sick leave will be granted.

E. This program shall be reviewed annually, and the Parties may mutually agree to negotiate appropriate modifications to the program which shall require formal ratification by the Union and adoption by the Board of Education.

F. The provisions of Sections 19.D.3. and 19.E.4. which relate to the application process and the approval of applications for the use of days from the leave bank shall not be subject to the grievance procedures contained in Article 15 of this Contract.
