GUIDELINES FOR THE REASSIGNMENT OF SENIORITY DATES WITHIN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE (Paraeducator Unit)

GOAL OF RESEARCH: Account for all time served as an hourly employee. Within the rules established below, determine whether the service was consistent with Education Code classified service exemptions and, if not, determine how the service should be applied to seniority within each classification and to district seniority.

GENERAL RULES

The work histories of all Paraeducator Unit employees will be studied. Included in the review are current supervisors and confidential employees with prior service in the Paraeducator Unit.

2. Many employees have current hire dates that are the same as their seniority dates. Do not exclude these employees as errors have frequently been found in the current hire dates. For work performed from 1974 until the present, the current hire date can be verified (within the month) by examining microfiche payroll records.

3. Do not exclude employees on leaves of absence or reemployment lists.

4. The terms and definitions of the SDUSD/CSEA Agreement settling San Diego Superior Court Case No. 00707784 prevail over conflicting language in these guidelines.

DATES TO BE REASSIGNED
