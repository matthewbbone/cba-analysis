ARTICLE 18. LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
Section 10. (continued)

D. Based upon the unit member’s corrected compensation, the District will deduct union dues retroactively owed to the Union from the unit member’s first regular monthly pay warrant following reinstatement.

Section 11: SUSPENDED REEMPLOYMENT

A. Prior to being reemployed under the provisions of this Contract, a laid off unit member may suspend his/her reemployment rights due to employment elsewhere for up to twelve (12) months from date of suspension.

B. During the period of suspended reemployment, the District will bypass the unit member’s name, provided there are other names on the reemployment list. If there are no other names remaining on the list, the suspended reemployment will be canceled and an offer of reemployment will be extended to the unit member pursuant to Section 9 of this Article.

C. Those unit members who suspend their reemployment due to employment elsewhere may reactivate their reemployment status at any time by delivering written notice to the Human Resource Services Division at least two (2) weeks prior to the desired reactivation date, providing it is within twelve (12) months of their original request for suspended reemployment.

D. In no event shall the provisions of this Section 11 be construed to provide unit members with a longer period of reemployment rights than those provided in Section 8.A. of this Article.

Section 12: PROHIBITION AGAINST TRANSFER OF BARGAINING UNIT WORK

If a bargaining unit position is reduced or eliminated and the work must continue to be performed, or the work is reinstated, it shall be assigned only to workers in the bargaining unit. In no event shall this work be performed by volunteers, so-called hourly workers, CSW’s or workers in other bargaining units, nor shall any unit member be offered hourly employment in order to avoid being laid off, reduced in hours or displaced. Laid off unit members will not be replaced with CSW’s, and existing bargaining unit positions that become vacant will not be filled with CSW’s. If the District eliminates a bargaining unit position in the future, it shall maintain a record of the position showing its work location.

Section 13: PROHIBITION AGAINST WAIVER OF BENEFITS

The District shall not encourage or require any unit member to waive health and welfare benefits in order to avoid a layoff or reduction in hours.
