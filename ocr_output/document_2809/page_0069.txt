ARTICLE 13. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCEDURE
Section 4. (continued)

C. If a special evaluation indicates that the unit member’s performance is not meeting standards, the evaluation shall include supporting documentation and a written action plan that specifies improvements needed and reasonable and mutually agreed to timelines for improvement. The supervisor shall conduct subsequent counseling and provide assistance to improve the unit member’s performance.

D. At least one (1) follow-up evaluation shall be administered pursuant to the timelines established in the action plan to assess whether or not the unit member’s performance has improved.

Section 5: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

A. Signing of the performance evaluation report may not necessarily mean the unit member is in agreement with the evaluation but shall signify that he/she has reviewed the evaluation and has received a copy of it. All performance evaluation reports will be forwarded to the unit member’s permanent personnel file.

B. Less-than-effective performance evaluation reports shall be based upon information which is supported by documentation.

C. Performance evaluation reports will not impact a unit member’s right to request a transfer.

D. Any changes in performance standards (defined as the factors on the performance evaluation report form) will be made known in writing to affected unit members before implementation.

Section 6: EVALUATION APPEALS

Performance evaluation reports express the judgment and opinions of supervisory authority, and as such are grievable only to the extent that the evaluation procedure was not followed. Within thirty (30) calendar days from the completion of the performance evaluation report, a unit member who believes that he/she has been unfairly or improperly evaluated shall have the right to submit to the supervisor a written signed rebuttal to the report which shall be attached to the performance evaluation report and included in the unit member’s permanent file. In addition, any unit member who has reason to question any aspect of his/her performance evaluation report has a right to review of his/her case by the performance evaluation reviewer (supervisor’s supervisor).
