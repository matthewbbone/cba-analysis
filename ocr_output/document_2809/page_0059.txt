ARTICLE 12. LEAVE POLICIES
Section 8.C.5.g.1. (continued)

(c) Estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the unit member needs to care for the individual, if the leave is due to the serious health condition of a child, spouse, domestic partner, or parent; and

(d) Statement that the serious health condition either warrants the participation of the unit member to provide care or renders the unit member unable to perform his/her job functions.

(2) If Family Care Leave is required beyond the initial estimated date provided by the health care provider, the unit member shall submit a new written notice and request for Family Care Leave before any additional leave will be granted. In addition, the unit member must submit a new certification from the relevant health care provider.

(3) If the District has any reason to doubt the validity of any health care provider's certification, the District may require, at its own expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated by the District. In the event the second health care provider's opinion differs from the original certification, the District may require, at its own expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion of a third health care provider approved jointly by the District and the unit member . The opinion of the third health care provider shall be final and binding on the District and the unit member.

h. Return to Work. As a condition of reinstatement for a unit member who has taken Family Care Leave because of his or her own serious health condition, the unit member must provide the District with a certification from his/her health care provider certifying that the unit member is able to resume work.

i. Reinstatement to Position. A unit member returning from a Family Care Leave shall be reinstated to the same position he/she held when the leave began or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay and other terms and conditions of employment. The District, however, shall not be required to reinstate unit member's returning from a Family Care Leave if, during the unit member's leave, the same or comparable position ceases to exist because of legitimate business reasons and, had the unit member not taken Family Care Leave, he/she would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested. A unit member returning from this leave will take preference over all others except for those laid off, in which case the unit member shall be ranked on the reemployment list according to his/her seniority. Upon resumption of his/her duties, the unit member shall be fully restored as a permanent unit member.
