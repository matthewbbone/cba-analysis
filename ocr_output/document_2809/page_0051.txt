ARTICLE 12. LEAVE POLICIES
Section 2.G. (continued)

Half-salary sick leave is to be used only after full-salary sick leave benefits have been exhausted. This Section G shall not apply to unit members having full-salary sick leave in excess of the limits shown above.

H. When a permanent unit member exhausts both full-salary and any half-salary sick leave allowances, he/she may request a health leave of absence without pay for a definite period of time not to exceed one (1) year, subject to renewal for a period up to a total of two (2) years. Requests must be accompanied by a physician's statement of incapacity. Return to duty is dependent upon the physician's statement of recovery.

I. Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery there from are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under the District's sick leave plan.

J. A unit member shall notify his/her supervisor or designee of any intended absence. One notice to the unit member's supervisor or designee of the unit member's intent to be off consecutive workdays shall meet the requirements for notification for the entire period absent if so specified at the time of initial notice. The supervisor may require the unit member to explain and/or provide proof that notification was not possible.

K. While absent on sick leave, unit members normally replaced by a substitute shall notify their supervisor or supervisor's designee of their absence at least one-half (1/2) hour prior to the beginning of the workday, unless conditions make notification impossible. All unit members shall notify their supervisor/designee prior to the beginning of the shift unless conditions make notification impossible.

L. Unit members shall notify their supervisor/designee of their intended return from absence as soon as known.

Section 3: SICK LEAVE INCENTIVE

A. Those unit members having perfect attendance (not using their annual sick leave allotment of 9, 10, 11, or 12 sick leave days) during one complete fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) shall be entitled to one (1) paid day of leave for personal, professional improvement (PPI) during the next fiscal year.

B. Attendance records for determining a unit member's eligibility for a personal, professional improvement (PPI) day will be maintained by the site or department where the unit member works. The (PPI) day requires prior approval of the department head or principal.

C. The personal, professional improvement day does not accrue from year to year and must be taken prior to June 30. If a unit member's request for the use of the (PPI) day is denied and the denial results in the loss of the (PPI) day, the unit member shall be paid for the day.
