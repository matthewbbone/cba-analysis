ARTICLE 15. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 4. (continued)

G. In any case in which the Union did not have a representative present at Level Three, the District shall not implement a proposed resolution of the grievance until the Union has received a copy of the grievance and has been given five (5) workdays within which to file a response. If the Union files a response, the division representative shall have five (5) workdays to consider that response and make any revisions to the written decision. If no response is filed by the Union, the decision of the division representative shall become final on the sixth (6th) workday following the rendering of the written decision of the division representative.

Section 5: LEVEL FOUR: MEDIATION

In the event the grievance remains unresolved after Level Three, the Union or the District may request that the State Mediation and Conciliation Service appoint a mediator to mediate the grievance. Any such request shall be made within fifteen (15) workdays after a Level Three decision is rendered. Within five (5) workdays of receipt of a request for mediation, the District shall file with the State a request for mediation. When necessary, timeline periods in Level Four will be automatically extended to meet the time constraints of the mediator.

Section 6: LEVEL FIVE: EXPEDITED ARBITRATION

A. In the event the grievance remains unresolved after Level Three, the District and the Union may mutually agree to appeal the grievance to expedited arbitration within fifteen (15) workdays after a Level Three decision is rendered.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the following expedited arbitration procedure is designed to provide prompt and efficient resolution of routine grievances. Grievances submitted to expedited arbitration shall be confined to issues which have limited contractual complexity.

C. Arbitration Selection

1. Arbitrators shall be appointed for a term of office of three (3) years beginning on the first day of July following the appointment and ending on the thirtieth (13th) day of June three (3) years later. When a vacancy occurs, the appointment shall be for the unexpired term of office. On or before the first (1st) day of July of the year in which a term expires, or as often as vacancies shall occur, nominations for appointment as an expedited arbitrator shall be made in rotation by the presiding judge of the Superior Court of the County of San Diego and the President of the Civil Service Commission of the City of San Diego. Both the District and the Union must approve nominations.

2. No person appointed as an expedited arbitrator may be an employee of the District at any time during his/her term of office.

3. Upon request for expedited arbitration, one arbitrator shall be assigned to hear the case. Arbitrators shall be assigned to cases on a rotating basis. If the selected arbitrator is for some reason, unable to serve, the next arbitrator in rotation will be assigned the case.
