ARTICLE 15. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 7.C. (continued)

3. Upon mutual agreement, a qualified stenographic reporter shall be employed to record verbatim the hearing. Without mutual agreement, either Party may employ and compensate such a reporter.

D. Powers and limitations of the arbitrator shall be as follows:

1. The functions of the arbitrator shall be:
   a. To hold a hearing concerning the grievance, and
   b. To render a binding decision within a reasonable period of time.

2. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this Contract but shall determine only whether or not there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Contract as alleged by the grievant or grievants.

3. The arbitrator shall have the power to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Contract or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Contract depends. The arbitrator may not decide any issue not submitted and may not interpret or apply the Contract so as to change what can fairly be said to have been the intent of the Parties as determined by generally accepted rules of contract construction. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award merely because, in the arbitrator's opinion, such decision or award is fair and equitable.

4. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented by the Parties in the presence of each other and upon arguments presented in briefs.

5. No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the beginning of the last payroll period prior to the fifteen (15) workday period for filing a grievance specified in Level Two of this grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall have no power to render an award in any grievance that does not arise during the term of this Contract.

Section 8: LEVEL SEVEN: APPEAL

A. The decision of the arbitrator under Section 6, Expedited Arbitration, or Section 7, Binding Arbitration, is not appealable by either Party except as provided in this Section and, unless so appealed, shall be the full, complete and final resolution of the grievance and implemented in accordance with these terms.
