Section 1: ELIGIBILITY

A. Eligible unit members are those active unit members in paid status in monthly salaried positions of one-half (½) time or more or those unit members on paid leaves receiving fifty percent (50%) or more of full salary. Unit members on district-approved unpaid leaves may continue their medical, dental, vision and/or life insurance coverage by remitting the required fee to the District. Unit members in monthly salaried positions of less than one-half (½) time have the option to enroll for medical plan coverage by paying the required fee on a tenthly pro-rata basis.

B. Eligible dependents are:

1. A unit member’s legal spouse who has not entered a final decree of divorce or an annulment from the unit member and is not on active duty as a member of the armed forces or an unmarried unit member’s same-sex domestic partner who is not on active duty as a member of the armed forces and is not legally married to another individual. It is understood that same-sex domestic partner coverage shall be subject to all eligibility rules and requirements established by the San Diego County Schools Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) and that such rules and requirements shall extend to all plans and coverages provided in this Article whether contracted through VEBA, self-funded by the District or directly contracted by the District. (A unit member’s domestic partner and the domestic partner’s children are not eligible for life and accident insurance coverage.) At such time as legal marriage, recognized by the State of California, is available to same-sex domestic partners, the Parties agree to review and modify the eligibility rules and requirements as necessary to provide that only legally married domestic partners shall be eligible.

2. A unit member’s unmarried child (including any stepchild, child of the unit member’s domestic partner, legally adopted child, or child for whom the unit member is named legal guardian by court order) who has not attained his/her nineteenth (19th) birthday, is not covered for benefits as an employee, and is not on active duty as a member of the armed forces.

3. A unit member’s unmarried child (including any stepchild, child of the unit member’s domestic partner, legally adopted child, or child for whom the unit member is named legal guardian by court order) who is at least nineteen (19) years of age but less than twenty-five (25) years of age (less than twenty-three [23] years of age for optional dependent life insurance), is primarily dependent upon the unit member for support and maintenance, and attends an accredited college, university, or vocational/technical school as a full-time student. The vocational/ technical school must be approved by the State Department of Education.

4. A unit member’s unmarried child (including any stepchild, child of the unit member’s domestic partner, legally adopted child, or child for whom the unit member is named legal guardian by court order) who is at least nineteen (19) years of age, is primarily dependent upon the unit member for support and maintenance, and is incapable of self-sustaining employment because of mental retardation or physical handicap incurred prior to age nineteen (19).
