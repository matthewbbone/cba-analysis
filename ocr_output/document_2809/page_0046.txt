ARTICLE 10. SAFETY CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT (continued)

Section 7: NOTIFICATION OF UNSAFE WORK CONDITIONS

A. Bargaining Unit Members shall notify their supervisors of unsafe or unsanitary conditions at any district work location or in any district vehicle. Unless an emergency exists, the report shall be made on a form supplied by the District. No reprisal of any kind shall be taken against a unit member as a result of reporting an unsafe or unsanitary work condition.

B. Supervisors shall promptly investigate any report of unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Within two (2) workdays of the completion of the investigation, the unit member shall be provided written notice of the findings of the investigation and of any proposed remedy. If the unit member believes a safety or health problem continues to exist after determination has been made by the site administrator or supervisor that the condition has been remedied, the District shall review the situation and any findings with the union representative in an attempt to resolve the issue.

C. No unit member shall be required to work in unsafe/unsanitary work conditions.

D. Upon request, a unit member shall be provided a consultation with the Director of Classified Personnel or designee, and/or a district physician to discuss job-related health concerns.

Section 8: REFUSAL TO WORK UNDER UNSAFE CONDITIONS

Bargaining Unit Members may refuse to work in any situation which places him/her in imminent physical danger or significantly endangers his/her health. In all such cases, the unit member shall first report the condition to the site administrator or supervisor who will, as soon as possible, have an evaluation made of the complaint. While the evaluation and determination of the complaint is being made, the unit member(s) will be given other assignments. Dependent upon the findings of the evaluation, the site administrator or supervisor shall inform the unit member(s) to return to the original assignment or shall inform the unit member of an alternate assignment.

Section 9: PUPIL TRANSPORTATION

Unless listed as a requirement in the position description, no unit member will be required to transport students in a privately-owned vehicle. Any activity to which a unit member transports students in the unit member’s private automobile must be approved by the principal or department head. The District’s general liability insurance shall cover the unit member while acting within the scope of his/her employment including the transportation of students. The limit of the District’s liability when an unit member uses his/her own car shall be as follows:

1. The District’s insurance coverage shall take effect only after the owner’s insurance company, as the prime carrier, has paid.

2. If the unit member is driving his/her car and is found negligent in the event of an accident with injury, District insurance shall cover the medical expenses for the occupants of the owner’s automobile; however, there is no District coverage for physical damage to the owner’s automobile. Therefore, unit members who transport students should carry appropriate automobile insurance coverage.
