ARTICLE 11. TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT POLICIES
Section 3 (continued)

B. Before any request for an administrative reassignment is acted upon, the unit member must be advised in writing (with copies provided to the Director, Classified Personnel) that an administrative reassignment is being recommended and the reasons for the reassignment.

C. Upon request, within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the notice of a proposed reassignment, the unit member will be provided an opportunity to meet with the Director, Classified Personnel and the supervisor to discuss the proposed reassignment.

D. Efforts will be made to implement reassignments in a timely manner. However, approved reassignments will be implemented with consideration given to site/department needs, unit member preferences and availability of appropriate vacancies.

Section 4: PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

At the time of hire or upon appointment to a new classification, each unit member shall be given a copy of his/her official district job description and information about the District’s Performance Evaluation Report form and job performance standards (defined as the factors on the Performance Evaluation Report form). Any changes in performance standards or expectations will be made known in writing to all affected unit members before implementation.

Section 5: RETURN TO FORMER CLASSIFICATION

A permanent unit member who has vacated a position to accept a promotion and who during the first thirty (30) calendar days of the probationary period requests to return to his/her former classification shall be reinstated to the former position, if vacant. Should the former position not be available, the unit member will be placed in a position equal in classification to the former position, provided an appropriate vacancy exists.

Section 6: ORDER OF REASSIGNMENT

A. Unit members who must be reassigned due to declining enrollment or reduction in staff shall be reassigned in order of least seniority within the job classification, unless a more senior volunteer in that class is available. Unit members in the affected classifications should be made aware of the opportunity to volunteer for the reassignment. Normally a more senior unit member shall not be permitted to volunteer for reassignment without the approval of the Director, Classified Personnel if the unit member is currently on an action plan or is facing pending disciplinary action. A unit member being reassigned shall not be required to participate in the competitive interview process.

B. Unit members reassigned under this provision will be given their choice of existing vacant positions in their classification with equal or greater number of hours or if no such vacancy exists, unit members may exercise their rights under Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment. If neither of these options results in a job placement, unit members shall be provided an interview for the first vacant position within any classification for which the unit member meets the minimum job qualifications. The right to a job interview shall be limited to the first thirty (30) calendar days following the effective date of the elimination of the unit member’s original position.
