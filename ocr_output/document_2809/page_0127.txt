records show restricted status assignments that have been converted to regular status. The information contained in these records should be verified, where possible, by other documentation (i.e. personnel action forms, assignment authorizations) as errors in status codes and dates have occasionally been found.

5. Mainframe

The on-line personnel system contains information that is limited to assignments since July 1, 1988, including hourly assignments.

When all other sources of information have been exhausted and employee history is still not complete, it will be necessary to ask the employee to provide additional information (i.e. pay stubs, personnel action forms). If the employee cannot provide documentation but does have a recollection of their former work, the information gained may be useful in researching other records (i.e. timesheets from archives).
