Section 7: PERSONAL NECESSITY LEAVE

A total of eight (8) days of sick leave benefits per fiscal year may be used for cases of personal necessity as follows. At the unit member’s request, this leave may, instead, be charged to vacation:

A. Death in the Immediate Family. Personal necessity leave may be used after bereavement leave benefits are exhausted.

C. Accident. A unit member may be released from duty when an accident involving the unit member, his/her immediate family, or property requires attention during scheduled work hours. The unit member may also be released from duty when his/her home is in imminent danger such as fire or flood.

D. Court Appearance. When a unit member appears in court as a litigant or as a witness and is excused from court appearance before serving three-fourths (3/4) of his/her normal shift, the unit member is required to return to work for that number of hours which, when added to the time of court appearance, equals the unit member’s normal shift for the day.

E. Family Illness. The supervisor may require verification by a physician if during duty hours a unit member needs to be present during a serious or critical illness of an immediate family member.

F. Religious Holiday. A unit member will be granted up to three (3) religious holidays of his/her faith per fiscal year, provided that notification is given to the supervisor at least five (5) workdays in advance of the religious holiday. The supervisor may require proof of observance.

G. Birth or Adoption of a Child. A father, upon the birth of his child, and parents, upon the adoption of a child, may use personal necessity leave.

H. Circumstances Beyond Unit Member’s Control/Acts of Nature. A unit member may be precluded from reporting for duty as a result of unpredictable and verifiable acts of nature or any other unpredictable and verifiable circumstance beyond the unit member’s control.
