ARTICLE 18. LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
(continued)

Section 14: INSTRUCTIONAL ASSISTANT II DISPLACEMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS

Unit members serving in Instructional Assistant II positions which are eliminated or reduced in hours shall have displacement and reemployment rights in the Instructional Assistant II classification. In addition, affected Instructional Assistant IIs shall also be provided with displacement rights to positions within the Paraeducator Bargaining Unit (in which the unit member has designated that they have worked) at one-half (1/2) hour more per day and the same length of work year from which they were displaced as an Instructional Assistant II. These dual reemployment rights to Instructional Assistant II and Paraeducator Bargaining Unit positions

shall be deemed to be exhausted at such time as the unit member has been offered an opportunity to be made whole in either classification or upon expiration of the unit member’s reemployment rights as specified in Section 9 of this Article.

2. Unit members on layoff desiring substitute work shall be given the right of first refusal for substitute work for which they meet the stated qualifications.
