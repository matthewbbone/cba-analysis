ARTICLE 18. LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
(continued)

Section 9: NOTIFICATION OF REEMPLOYMENT

A. Unless the Parties agree otherwise a unit member who is laid off and becomes eligible for reemployment shall be notified by certified mail addressed to the last known address on file with the Human Resource Services Division.

B. Unless the Parties agree otherwise a unit member shall have five (5) workdays from receipt of notice by certified mail to respond to the offer of reemployment.

C. Upon acceptance of reemployment, the unit member shall have five (5) workdays to report for work unless the District agrees to an extension of the reporting date. Such extension shall be solely at the discretion of the District.

D. Should the notice of reemployment be undeliverable or the noticed unit member not accept the offer of reemployment, the unit member's name shall be removed from the reemployment list, and he/she shall be deemed to have resigned from the District.

E. A unit member who is reduced in hours shall have the right to refuse offers of reemployment at the original or greater hours, up to a maximum of three (3) offers, at which time the unit member shall be deemed to have exhausted his/her reemployment rights. Unit members who are reduced in hours and become eligible for reemployment shall be notified by telephone by the Human Resource Services Division and shall have five (5) workdays from receipt of the notice to respond to the offer of reemployment. If there are no other names remaining on the reemployment list, the right of a unit member to refuse up to three (3) offers of reemployment at the original or greater hours, will be canceled and an offer of reemployment will be extended to the unit member.

Section 10: ERROR IN LAYOFF

A. When it is determined that a unit member has been laid off or reduced in work hours in error, the unit member will be notified in writing and will be reinstated without loss of compensation.

B. The unit member shall be credited with any sick leave, vacation leave, and holiday leave which would have been earned but for the error in layoff or reduction in work hours.

C. If the unit member is otherwise eligible for medical, dental, vision or life insurance, he/she will be enrolled prospectively and will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket premium incorrectly collected by the District during the period of the error in layoff. If the unit member did not retain coverage which he/she should have been provided during the period of error in layoff/reduction, the unit member may file a claim with the District for reimbursement of health and welfare expenses incurred during that time. Reimbursements shall be consistent with the unit member's established benefit plan(s). Such claims must be submitted with copies of bills provided.
