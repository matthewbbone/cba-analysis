ARTICLE 7. WAGES
Section 9 (continued)

C. Assignment Change From Less Than Four (4) Hours to Four (4) or More Hours Per Day.
When an unit member's assignment is increased from less than four (4) hours per day to four (4) or more hours per day, the anniversary date will not change and unit members who have not reached Step "D.5" will receive a one (1) step salary increase on the next scheduled anniversary date as established in Section 9.1. Unit members on Step "D.5" will advance to Step "E.5" on their next anniversary date.

D. Assignment Change from Four (4) or More Hours to Less than Four (4) Hours Per Day.
When a unit member's assignment is decreased from four (4) or more hours per day to less than four (4) hours per day the anniversary date will not change and unit members who have not reached the "D.5" Step will receive a one-half (1/2) step salary increase on the next scheduled anniversary date as established in Section 9.B. Unit members on Step "E" or "E.5" remain on that step.

E. Merit Increments. A regular monthly unit member eligible for service increments in accordance with Section 8.1 and who is assigned to an exempt job class (those not eligible for premium overtime pay) and whose work performance is deemed to be outstanding may be granted a one (1) step salary increase at any time upon recommendation of the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, and approval by the Board of Education. In such instances, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, will provide written notification to the Union. When such a merit increment has been granted, a new anniversary or annual increment due date will be established if such placement is at a step less than the maximum for the job class.

Section 10: HOURLY AND DAILY PAY CALCULATIONS

Hourly pay rates for regular classified unit members on monthly salaries and for temporary unit members assigned to job classes on the regular classified salary schedule are determined by dividing the monthly rates by 173.33. (This divisor is an industry-wide norm which represents the average number of working hours in the work month.) Daily pay rates are determined by multiplying the hourly rates by the number of regular hours assigned per workday.

Section 11: PART-MONTH PAY CALCULATIONS AND DEDUCTIONS FOR MONTHLY PAID POSITIONS

A. A newly hired unit member will have the initial monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. A terminating unit member will have the terminal monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. Pay so determined for that month will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate.

B. A unit member who is promoted or demoted other than on the first workday of the month will have the pay for that month prorated on the basis of the number of days worked in the month in each job class. In this instance only, the daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly salary by the number of potential workdays in the month including mandated and declared holidays.
