ARTICLE 12. LEAVE POLICIES

Section 1: SCOPE OF LEAVE POLICIES

The District will provide to eligible unit members the leaves set forth in this Article and any other leaves mandated by state law.

Section 2: SICK LEAVE

A. Eligible unit members shall be allowed full-salary sick leave for personal illness, injury or exposure to contagious disease as set forth in the California Education Code and for the unit member’s medical, dental or vision appointments.

B. Full-time unit members shall accrue eight (8) hours of sick leave for each month of employment in their assignment year. Part-time unit members shall accrue sick leave in the same proportion as their employment bears to full time. Unit members working on a single-track year-round calendar shall accrue the same amount of sick leave on an annual basis as unit members working on a traditional calendar.

C. Pay for any day of absence for which sick leave benefits are authorized shall be the same as the pay which would have been received had the unit member served during the day.

D. Full-salary sick leave not used shall be accumulated from year to year without limit.

E. New unit members of the District accrue sick leave from the first (1st) of the month in which employed, provided their employment commences on or before the fifteenth (15th) of the month. If employment commences on or after the sixteenth (16th) of the month, sick leave accrual starts the following month. Sick leave will be accrued to the end of the month for a terminating unit member, provided the last day of service is on or after the sixteenth (16th) of the month. Sick leave will be accrued to the end of the previous month if the terminating unit member’s last day of service is on or before the fifteenth (15th) of the month.

F. Unit members may apply for sick leave benefits in advance of accrual up to a maximum of the current fiscal year's entitlement. Terminating unit members who have received unaccrued sick leave benefits shall have their final warrant adjusted by the amount of the unearned sick leave taken.

G. In addition to full-salary sick leave, each unit member shall be entitled to one-hundred (100) half-salary sick leave days each fiscal year. The combination of full-salary and half-salary sick leave shall not exceed the following limits:

nine (9) month unit members 109 days
ten (10) month unit members 110 days
eleven (11) month unit members 111 days
twelve (12) month unit members 112 days
