ARTICLE 7. WAGES

Section 1: PARAEDUCATOR SALARY SCHEDULE

A. Effective July 1, 2001, the 2001-2002 salary rates shall be increased one and thirty-six-hundredths percent (1.36%).

B. If any other entire bargaining unit or entire unrepresented employee group within the District receives a general salary/wage increase using unrestricted resources or receives another form of compensation not previously allocated to that entire bargaining unit or entire unrepresented group in settlement of the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 negotiations, the bargaining unit shall be entitled to a commensurate pro-rata amount of compensation. In such an event, the Union and the District shall enter into negotiations to determine the manner in which to compensate the bargaining unit. Increases in salary or other forms of compensation resulting from negotiations shall not exceed a commensurate pro-rata share provided to any other entire bargaining unit or entire employee group within the District.

C. For any year covered by this contract, should the District receive new Revenue Limit Equalization Aid and/or Revenue Limit Deficit Reduction funding, such funding will be converted into an equivalent percentage increase for all employees in the following amounts:

Deficit Reduction: One hundred percent (100%) of funds received will be converted.

Equalization Aid: Fifty percent (50%) of funds received will be converted.

If Equalization Aid and/or Deficit Reduction is on-going, the pro-rata increase for the Paraeducators Bargaining Unit shall be added to the salary schedule. The remainder of the Revenue Limit Deficit Reduction funding for 2000-2001 has been determined to be .092%. This amount will be paid as a pro-rata increase for the unit members on the salary schedule retroactive to July 1, 2000.

If Equalization Aid and/or Deficit Reduction is not on-going, the pro-rata increase for the Paraeducators Bargaining Unit shall be used to calculate an off-schedule bonus in each of the years in which the funds are received. The Revenue Limit Equalization Aid amount for the 2001-2002 year has been determined to be .05%. This amount shall be paid as an off-schedule bonus for 2001-2002. This amount will be included in the revenue limit deficit reduction retroactive pay warrant.

D. Should any other entire bargaining unit or entire unrepresented employee group within the District agree to or receive any salary/wage formula which results in increased compensation for 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004, the bargaining unit shall be entitled to the same provision(s). Increases in salary/wage or other forms of compensation resulting from reopenner negotiations shall not exceed a commensurate pro-rata share provided to any other entire bargaining unit or entire unrepresented employee group within the District.
