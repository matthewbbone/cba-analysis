ARTICLE 12. LEAVE POLICIES
Section 5 (continued)

B. Unit members in part-time positions shall earn vacation in proportion to the time their assignment bears to a full-time position.

C. The maximum accumulation of vacation shall be 328 hours for each unit member. Each unit member shall be responsible for monitoring his/her own vacation balance to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum accumulation. A unit member may be required by his/her supervisor to use vacation in order to avoid reaching the maximum accumulation.

D. Unit members who have reached the maximum accumulation of vacation, or may exceed the maximum accrual allowed during the next pay period, will be provided with the opportunity to use earned vacation leave. If a unit member request is denied and the denial results in the loss of accumulated leave, the unit member shall be paid for the actual amount of accrued vacation time lost.

This provision shall apply only to those unit members who have reached the maximum accumulation of vacation leave or to unit members who may exceed the maximum vacation accrual rate during the next pay period.

E. Upon separation, a unit member shall be entitled to a lump sum payment for all accumulated but unused vacation hours. Unit members who terminate before serving six (6) months shall not be entitled to any accumulated vacation.

F. Unit members shall schedule their vacation at the convenience of the District and with the approval of the principal, department head, or division head, except that unit members may be required to take their vacation during winter and spring recess periods.

G. A unit member, who while on vacation, has a death in the immediate family as defined in Article 12, Section 6, shall have the right to use bereavement leave and, if necessary, personal necessity leave be substituted for vacation during each day affected.

H. A unit member who, while on vacation, has suffered a disability, injury or illness shall have the right to use sick leave credits to substitute for vacation during each day of such disability. A statement from a licensed physician fulfilling these requirements may be requested by the supervisor.

I. Permanent ten (10) and eleven (11) month unit members in the second through sixth year of vacation entitlement will be permitted to accumulate a negative vacation hours balance. Full-time unit members can accumulate a maximum negative balance of forty (40) hours. Part-time unit members can accumulate a maximum negative balance equal to five (5) months of vacation accrual to a maximum of forty (40) hours. When negative vacation balances exceed forty (40) hours, or if a unit member separates with a negative balance, the payroll docking process occurs.
