ARTICLE 16. ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY
Section 4.A.3. (continued)

    a. Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities

    b. Ronald McDonald House

    c. Children’s Hospital Foundation

B. In the event a non-member does not pay such fee directly to the Union or qualify as an objector exempt from the fee, the Union shall so inform the District in writing, with a copy to the unit member certifying these facts and the correct amount of the fee owed. The District shall then begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in California Education Code Section 45168.

Section 5: FAIR SHARE EXEMPTIONS

A. Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations or any unit member who has deeply held, long-term philosophical objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support the Union. Such unit members shall apply to the Union for an exemption as described herein. The Union shall develop a process for granting/denying such applications, including appeal rights for applications denied which provide for hearing by a neutral third party.

B. Provided that the Union has no cause to presume a change in the religious/philosophical exemption status of a unit member once an exemption is granted it need not be reviewed on an annual basis. However, proof of payment of the charitable funds, pursuant to this Section, shall be made on an annual basis to the Union as a condition of continued exemption from the provisions of Section 4 above.

C. Proof of payment (in lieu of the service fee) shall be in the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment was made. Such proof shall be presented on or before the date required for a lump sum payment of fair share fees in each school year.

D. Any unit member making charitable contributions as set forth in this Article, and who requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in his/her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures.
