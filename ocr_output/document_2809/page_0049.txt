ARTICLE 11. TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT POLICIES (continued)

Section 7: SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION

When schools in adjacent attendance zones are consolidated, the classified staffing for the resulting school(s) shall be accomplished as follows:

A. The District shall identify the authorized positions for the consolidated school(s) by classification, special training, and experience appropriate to program needs.

B. Unit members in all of the schools affected by the consolidation may request placement in any of the identified position openings for which they have the required classifications, training, and experience.

C. Up to five (5) Paraeducator position vacancies shall be selected by the principal or site supervisor from incumbent qualified unit members in the affected schools.

D. For position vacancies other than those referred to in Section 7.C. above, incumbent qualified unit members will be selected in order of their seniority.

E. Unit members reassigned under this provision will be given their choice, by seniority within classification, of existing vacant positions in their classification with equal or greater number of hours or if no such vacancy exists, unit members may exercise their rights under Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment. If neither of these options results in a job placement, unit members shall be provided an interview for the first vacant position for which the unit member qualifies. The right to a job interview shall be limited to the first thirty (30) calendar days following the effective date of the elimination of the unit member's original position. If additional authorized positions are created by the consolidation, selection of additional unit members shall be accomplished under the provisions of the Employment Regulations for the Classified Service of the San Diego Unified School District.
