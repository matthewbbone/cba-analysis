ARTICLE 8. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT
(continued)

Section 3: INCREASES IN ASSIGNED TIME

The District retains the right to increase the assigned workday or work year for unit members, in accordance with the following procedures:

A. Whenever the District increases the workday or work year of a position, it shall offer such increases to unit members who hold the positions being increased.

B. In the event the incumbent who holds the position declines an offer of an increase to his/her workday or work year, other unit members in the same classification at that site may request the increase in hours and shall meet with the selecting administrator and be considered for the position first, before all others.

C. Prior to permanent increases in the workday or work year, unit members will be provided at least thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice of the change. Exceptions may be made in emergencies or by mutual agreement of the unit member and the supervisor.

D. The District may temporarily assign a unit member to a work schedule not routinely worked by such unit member for a maximum of thirty (30) workdays unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the unit member and the supervisor. A unit member shall not be required to accept such assignment unless notified five (5) workdays prior to the effective date of the work schedule change.

Section 4: LUNCH PERIODS

A. Each unit member assigned for more than five (5) hours per day shall be entitled to an unpaid duty-free lunch period of thirty (30) minutes. Taking into consideration the unit member's preference and needs of the program/assignment, unit members who work more than five (5) hours, but less than six (6) hours per day, may waive their lunch period upon mutual agreement of the supervisor and the unit member.

B. Unit members shall not be assigned standby or other duty during the lunch period and are free to leave the work location during the lunch period.

C. In accordance with Section 4.A. above, eligible unit members assigned to more than one site shall be provided with a duty-free lunch exclusive of travel time between work locations.

D. If the unit member's duty free lunch period is interrupted concerning work-related matters, the unit member shall be entitled to extend his/her lunch period by the same amount of time resulting from the interruption.

E. Times when unit members may take their unpaid duty free lunch periods shall be determined by the unit member's supervisor taking unit members' preferences and program/assignment needs into consideration. Normally, the lunch period shall be as close to the middle of the shift as feasible.
