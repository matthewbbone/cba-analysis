B. The District will contribute $5,000 to the fund annually. These funds will be carried over if not expended during the fiscal year.

C. Unit members who participate in professional development activities related to job-connected skills or potential careers with the District may qualify to have the cost of the activity fees covered by available funds. This shall be for the actual cost of the activity or the cost of a substitute to accommodate attendance at such activity.
