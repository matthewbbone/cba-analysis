2. Unit members in assignments of at least four (4) hours per day/five (5) days per week but less than eight (8) hours per day/five (5) days per week will be compensated for all time worked on the sixth (6\textsuperscript{th}) and seventh (7\textsuperscript{th}) day of the workweek. This rule does not apply to unit members in exempt job classes.

3. Unit members in assignments of less than four (4) hours per day/five (5) days per week will be compensated for all time worked on the seventh (7\textsuperscript{th}) day of the workweek. This rule does not apply to unit members in exempt job classes.
