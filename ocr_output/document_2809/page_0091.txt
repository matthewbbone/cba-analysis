ARTICLE 18. LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
(continued)

Section 5: TIMING OF LAYOFFS AND REDUCTIONS IN HOURS

A. Unit members to be laid off or reduced in hours shall be given written notice of layoff or reduction in hours not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of layoff or reduction in hours. Nothing herein provided shall preclude a layoff or reduction in hours for lack of funds in the event of an actual and existing financial inability to pay salaries of unit members, nor layoff or reduction in hours resulting from causes not foreseeable or preventable by the Board, without the notice required in this Section 5.

B. The Union shall be given a minimum of seven (7) workdays advance written notice of the names of unit members laid off or reassigned under the provisions of this Article, as well as their classification, work location, and seniority dates, prior to the Board of Education taking action on any resolution to reduce or eliminate positions in the Paraeducator Bargaining Unit.

Section 6: ORDER OF LAYOFF

A. Unit members shall be laid off or reduced in hours, by classification, according to their status in the following order: (1) substitute; (2) probationary; and (3) permanent. In the case of permanent and probationary unit members, classification seniority will be the determining factor.

B. In the event of a tie in classification seniority, the unit member with least district seniority shall be laid off. If a tie still exists, the unit member with the most recent initial hire date shall be laid off. Lots will be drawn in the presence of a Union representative to break remaining ties.

C. Whenever a unit member is laid off or reduced in hours, the order of layoff or reduction in hours shall be determined by length of service in the classification, plus service in equal and higher salary grades. The unit member with the least amount of classification seniority plus service in equal and higher salary grades shall be laid off or reduced in hours first. Service in substitute status shall not count toward seniority in the classification. Service in temporary out-of-classification assignments shall not count toward seniority in the classification to which the unit member was temporarily assigned.

Section 7: DISPLACEMENT RIGHTS

A. A unit member in a position which has been eliminated or reduced shall be provided displacement rights in the following order:

1. The unit member shall be bumped into a vacant position or shall bump the least senior unit member in the same classification, whichever opportunity provides the highest number of hours per day and months per work year.

2. When the vacancy and the least senior unit member’s hours and work year are equal, the displaced unit member shall be bumped to the vacancy.
