Section 1: UNION REPRESENTATION

A. The method of selection of union stewards is solely the responsibility of the Union.

B. The Union will be allowed at least one (1) Paraeducator union steward and at least one (1) alternate for each department/site organizational unit.

C. Designated alternates shall act for the union steward only in the absence of the union steward. The Union shall designate its stewards and alternates in writing and shall provide the District with a master list of union stewards and alternates not later than ninety (90) calendar days after ratification of this Contract and once annually each October.

D. The District shall recognize such changes only upon official notification from the Union. All such changes will be delivered in writing to the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or his/her designee, who will make notification to appropriate site and district offices and personnel.

Section 2: RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF UNION REPRESENTATIVES

A. Union representatives, (staff, officers and stewards) shall be granted access to district premises for the purposes of administration of this Contract and shall have the right during their regular work hours to investigate, present, and process grievances; to attend, at the request of the unit member, any conference at which unit member discipline is intended to be administered or during which the unit member reasonably believes the investigation may lead to disciplinary action; and to conduct appropriate and official union business, without loss of time, pay, or benefits, providing that all time shall be paid at straight time for the shift involved.

B. All union business performed by union representatives, other than that related to grievances and, at the unit member’s request, attendance at conferences at which unit member discipline is intended to be administered or during which the unit member reasonably believes the investigation may lead to disciplinary action, shall be conducted during non-work hours. Non-work hours are defined as before and after the assigned hours of work and during lunch periods and rest breaks.

C. When a union representative serves more than one school or department site, the union representative shall have the right to visit areas, schools, or departments within his/her jurisdiction at reasonable times for the purposes specified in Section 2.A. above upon securing permission from his/her principal, department supervisor, or designee. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
