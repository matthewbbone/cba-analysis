C. Salary reductions for all unpaid time in accordance with negotiated contracts and district policy and procedure will involve a reduction in pay at the unit member's daily rate for each day of absence. Total reductions so determined will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate. No pay will be drawn when such days missed involve a full calendar month regardless of the number of workdays in that month. Salary reductions for fifty percent (50%) sick leave will be at one-half (1/2) of the unit member's daily rate.

D. An unit member changing mid-year from a conventional work year schedule to a year-round schedule (or vice versa) will have the conventional assignment pay calculation (based on the mid-month promotion rule above) and the year-round pay calculation (based on a daily rate) completed so as to result in equal monthly payments for the remainder of the school year.

The initial pay in the new assignment will be a balancing payment. Year-round classified unit member monthly rates are determined in the following manner: 1) The number of days of service in the traditional work year for the job class is multiplied by the daily rate, determined in accordance with the daily pay calculation method (monthly rate/173.33) X 8, to determine an annual salary. 2) Inasmuch as the year-round assignment has the same number of paid days, the annual salary so determined is divided by twelve (12) to establish the year-round monthly rate.

Section 12: COMPENSATION FOR WORKSHOP PARTICIPATION

The California or federal minimum wage rate (whichever is higher) applies to regular monthly classified unit members of the San Diego Unified School District who participate in workshops at the request of the District. This rate will be paid only for workshop participation outside the unit member's normal workdays and/or hours. Such qualifying workshop participation will be paid at the straight or overtime workshop participation rate in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.

Unit members who are required to attend workshops at the request of the District will be paid at their regular straight or overtime rate of pay in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.

Section 13: UNIT MEMBERS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN SALARY SCHEDULES

A unit member transferring between salary schedules will be placed and continued in employment in accordance with the rules and regulations of the salary schedule to which the unit member is transferring without regard to the basis for such transfer (promotion, demotion, etc.).
