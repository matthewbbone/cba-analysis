Section 15: PLACEMENT IN LOWER JOB CLASS

A. Demotions Due to Unit member Request or Disciplinary Reasons. When a permanent unit member is placed in a position in a lower job class in the same type of work at the unit member's own request or if a permanent unit member is demoted in accordance with The Employment Regulations for the Classified Service of the San Diego Unified School, the salary step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be that which is approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half percent [7.5%]) in amount below the unit member's salary in the higher class. Unit members who reach the maximum step in the higher class or on a step in the higher class which is more than seven and one-half (7.5%) above the maximum step of the lower job class will be placed on the maximum step of the lower class. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum salary for the lower job class has been achieved. If the reassignment is to a position in a lower job class with a different type of work the step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be at the same dollar rate. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade, the unit member will be placed on the step that will result in the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate.

B. Demotions Due to Classification Review or in Lieu of Layoff. When a permanent unit member is reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position, or demoted in lieu of layoff, or for some other reasons in the district's best interest, the unit member will be placed on the step at the same dollar rate, exclusive of any special pay additive, if such rate appears in the lower salary grade. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the demotion is from a half grade to a whole grade, or vice versa, the unit member's salary will be changed to the step which provides the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum for the lower job class has been achieved. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the maximum rate is less than the unit member's current pay rate, the unit member's salary, exclusive of any special pay additive, will be maintained as it was prior to demotion for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months unless the maximum for the lower job class is changed to exceed the previously achieved salary. At the end of the eighteen (18) month period, the salary will be changed to the maximum for the lower job class. A permanent unit member so protected and who is assigned on a temporary basis, for up to ninety (90) calendar days, to a position in the job class from which he/she was demoted in lieu of layoff will be placed on the same salary step of the range for his/her job class as that held at the time of demotion. When such temporarily reassigned unit member is again moved to the lower job class, he/she will receive the same dollar rate as was originally protected and the original eighteen (18) month period will be extended for each month or major fraction thereof during which the unit member was temporarily promoted.

C Reemployment Rights for Unit Members reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position will be determined in the same manner as in Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment, Sections 8 and 9.
