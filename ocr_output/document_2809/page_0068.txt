ARTICLE 13. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCEDURE

Unit members will not be scheduled for regular performance evaluations and will be considered as meeting job performance standards unless a special performance evaluation (commendation or counseling) is performed as described in Section 4 of this Article. Scheduled performance evaluations will be limited to probationary and permanent/probationary unit members

Section 1: PURPOSE OF EVALUATION

The District and the Union agree that evaluation is the careful, systematic appraisal of unit member work performance through the use of Performance Evaluation Reports. The evaluation process is a method of measuring a unit member’s performance against the standards of the position (defined as the factors on the Performance Evaluation Report Form).

Section 2: SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS

A. At the time of hire or upon appointment to a new classification, each unit member shall be given a copy of his/her official district job description and information about the district’s performance evaluation report form, procedure and job performance standards.

B. Probationary and Permanent/Probationary (as defined in Article 5) unit member’s performance evaluation reports shall be completed any time prior to the end of the sixth (6th) month and at least one (1) month prior to completion of the probationary period. For the purposes of this Section, a permanent unit member who is probationary in classification shall be evaluated in the same manner as a probationary unit member.

C. The supervisor will prepare the performance evaluation report for discussion with the unit member. During this conference, the unit member and supervisor will review the evaluation which may result in its modification.

Section 3: COUNSELING

Supervisors shall notify and counsel unit members in a timely manner of any unacceptable or deteriorating performance that may, if not corrected, affect their performance evaluation or lead to a special evaluation.

Section 4: SPECIAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

A. A special performance evaluation report for a unit member may be prepared at any time by his/her supervisor. Such evaluation reports may be used to provide a record of either a deterioration or an improvement in unit member performance or for recording formal commendations for outstanding performance.

B. The supervisor will give the unit member at least two (2) work days notice of a schedule special performance evaluation meeting.
