ARTICLE 15. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 6. (continued)

D. The expedited arbitrator shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the following:

1. The hearing shall be informal.

2. No briefs shall be filed or transcripts made.

3. There shall be no formal evidence rules.

4. Each Party’s case shall be presented by a previously-designated representative.

5. The arbitrator shall have the obligation of assuring that all necessary facts and considerations are brought before him/her by the representatives of the Parties.

6. If the arbitrator or the Parties conclude at the hearing that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to require further consideration by the Parties, the case shall be referred back to the appropriate place in the grievance procedure.

7. The arbitrator shall either make an oral/bench award or issue a decision within five (5) workdays after conclusion of the Hearing. The arbitrator’s decision shall be based on the records developed by the Parties before and at the hearing and shall include a brief written explanation of the basis for his/her conclusion. These decisions shall not be cited as precedent in any discussion at any step of the grievance or arbitration procedure. The arbitrator’s decision is binding.

8. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this Contract but shall determine only whether or not there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Contract as alleged by the grievant or grievants.

9. The arbitrator shall have the power to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Contract or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Contract depends. The arbitrator may not decide any issue not submitted and may not interpret or apply the Contract so as to change what can fairly be said to have been the intent of the Parties as determined by generally accepted rules of contract construction. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award merely because, in the arbitrator’s opinion, such decision or award is fair and equitable.

10. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented by the Parties in the presence of each other.

11. No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the beginning of the last payroll period prior to the fifteen (15) workday period for filing a grievance specified in Level Two of this grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall have no power to render an award in any grievance that does not arise during the term of the Contract.
