If an employee accepts a demotion in lieu of lay-off, he/she retains but does not continue to accrue classification seniority in the previous (higher) classification.

Reclassifications

Where seniority involves work that was subsequently reclassified, the new classification is assigned as of the effective date stipulated by Wage and Compensation at the time the study was done, unless the parties agree on a different date, consistent with the Education Code.

FOLLOW-UP PROCESS FOR REVIEW BY EMPLOYEE

After research is completed for the classified employees in a department/site, the following actions shall be jointly undertaken by the District and CSEA:

1. Send each employee (including those whose dates will not change) a summary of their employment history with the recommended revisions. A period of ten (10) days will be allowed for review by the employee. After reviewing the recommendations, if the employee agrees with the conclusions, the employee will be asked to sign a form indicating their agreement. Upon their signature, a change in their seniority dates will be authorized. If they do not agree with the information provided, their response needs to include the dates and classifications with which they disagree as well as their assessment of the correct dates and classifications. If the employee fails to return their form within the ten (10) days allowed, the revision will automatically be accepted.

2. A follow-up process will review all contested employment histories.
