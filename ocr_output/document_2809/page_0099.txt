ARTICLE 20. SUMMER SCHOOL/INTERSESSION
(continued)

Section 4: SALARY AND BENEFITS

A. Unit members who are employed in summer school or intersession assignments shall be paid on a pro-rata basis, no less than the salary and benefits that would apply to the appropriate classification during the regular school year.

B. Summer school and intersession unit members shall be permitted to take paid sick leave time, shall be paid for holidays occurring within the assignment and shall earn sick leave and vacation credit for time assigned during the summer session or intersession.

Section 5: NOTIFICATION OF ASSIGNMENT

As soon as possible prior to the first day of summer school, unit members will be notified of their specific assignment. However, because of late (unanticipated) pupil enrollment, the final phase of summer school staffing may occur during the first week of summer session.

Section 6: CANCELLATION

A. The District reserves the right to cancel summer school/intersession classes as appropriate based on enrollment or emergencies.

B. Unit members scheduled to specific classes which are closed due to low enrollments will be given consideration for other vacancies that occur; however, such unit members do not have priority over other unit members selected for, and notified of, summer session placement.

Section 7: JOINT UNION/DISTRICT COMMITTEE

Problems regarding the implementation of this Article shall be referred to the Contract Administration Committee for review and resolution.
