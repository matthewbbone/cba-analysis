employee may be separated from one job class or location but continue to work in another. The microfiche pay records should document that employment was continuous.

Leaves of Absence

There are several types of LOA's. Long-term leaves for illness or injury are not considered a break in service (Education Code 45192, 45195). For other types of leaves (i.e. professional study), the guidelines are found in the collective negotiations agreements (the collective negotiations agreements limit continued seniority accrual while on leave to health and pregnancy).

For LOA's where seniority does not continue to accrue, the lost days of service are totaled and "subtracted" from the employee's revised classification seniority dates. Calendars for each of these adjustments should be kept so that the adjusted date can easily be reviewed in the future.

Transfer Between Classified and Certificated Job Classes

If an employee of a school district employed in a position in the classified service is assigned to a position in the same district requiring certification qualifications, the employee shall retain all sick leave, vacation, and other rights and benefits accumulated by the employee at the time he or she is assigned to a position requiring certification qualifications. All seniority and permanency rights shall be secured to the employee during the period of time he or she occupies a position in the certificated service. The employee's return to the classified service at any time shall be treated as if there had not been an interruption in his or her classified service. (Education Code 44064)

Voluntary Demotion

When an employee accepts a voluntary demotion, he/she continues to accrue district seniority. If the employee is later reemployed in the higher classification, the time served in the lower class does not count towards seniority in the higher class.
