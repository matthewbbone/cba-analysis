ARTICLE 7. WAGES
Section 6 (continued)

D. Job Classes Without Asterisks. Unit members other than those referred to in Sections 6.A.2 and 6.A.3 will be compensated at one and one-half times the equivalent hourly rate of pay for the unit member's job class and salary grade step as contained in this schedule. Unit members will be compensated at two (2) times the equivalent hourly rate of pay for the unit member's job class and salary grade step as contained in this schedule for work performed on any seventh (7th) consecutive workday where the unit member has worked hours on the six (6) preceding calendar days entitling him/her to compensation. Only the seventh (7th) consecutive workday will entitle the unit member to double time. All other workdays will be paid in accordance with the existing rules and regulations contained in this salary schedule.

E. Overtime of less than six (6) minutes. Overtime worked in units of less than six (6) minutes will be disregarded for purposes of compensation.

F. Work On Holidays. Work performed by regular unit members on the date of observance scheduled on the District's Master Calendar for any legal or declared holiday enumerated in Article 12, Leave Policies, will be considered as overtime without regard to the number of hours worked on other days of that week and will be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the unit member's regular rate of pay for nonexempt unit members and one (1) times the unit member's regular rate for exempt unit members. Such holiday pay will be in addition to the unit member's regular compensation for the holiday.

G. Overtime Compensation for Special Pay Additive(s). Compensation for overtime will include any special pay additive(s) and may be in the form of payment by warrant or compensatory time off of equivalent value to such payment. Compensatory time off records should be maintained in the appropriate department/site office and such time off shall be permitted within a reasonable time following the day on which overtime is worked, otherwise, the unit member shall be paid by warrant. To the extent possible, ordinary overtime work and method of compensation (either overtime pay or compensatory time off) shall be by mutual agreement between the unit member and supervisor.

Section 7: SPECIAL PAY ADDITIVES

A. Shift Differential. A unit member assigned to work a regular, continuing schedule of four (4) hours per day or more in which four (4) hours or more of such regular shift are worked before 8 a.m. or after 6 p.m. is entitled to shift differential pay. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.

B. Hazard Pay Differential. A unit member will receive a hazard pay differential for assignment to a position designated by the Board of Education as a hazard pay position. A hazard pay position is one which: (1) continuously exposes the unit member to a specific and significant hazard, (2) is clearly dangerous to the health or well being of any unit member so assigned, and (3) the hazard is atypical of the basic occupation or job class. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.
