Section 1: DUES DEDUCTIONS

Any unit member who is a member of the Union, or who applies for membership, may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of membership dues and such other mutually agreed payroll deductions as may be offered by the Union. Such authorization shall continue from year to year, unless revoked by the individual for the duration of this contract. Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall implement a twelve (12) month dues deduction schedule in accordance with parameters established by the Union.

Section 2: ESTABLISHMENT OF DUES SCHEDULE

The Union may determine the dues schedule for all members of the Union. Changes to the dues schedule may be made by the Union without necessitating a new dues deduction authorization from any current member. The Union will give the District thirty (30) days advance notice of any changes in the dues schedule.

Section 3: PAYMENT OF MONIES

With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization by the unit member, the District agrees to remit such monies without cost to the Union, within seven (7) workdays, accompanied by an alphabetical listing of the unit members for whom such deductions have been made. This list will include unit member’s name, social security number, payroll number, site location, deduction amount.
