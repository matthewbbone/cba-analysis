Section 12: COSTS OF HEARING

A. The hearing officers may receive a stipend commensurate with services rendered. The amount of any stipend shall be established by separate action of the Board of Education whose discretion in this matter shall be complete and final. If the appeal is denied, the appellant shall share equally in the cost of the stipend for the Classified Employees Hearing Officer. Any unit member who is financially unable to pay his/her share of the cost of the stipend may petition the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, for relief therefrom. This petition shall be in the form of a letter in which the employee sets forth the reasons for the request for relief. The Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, shall act to grant or deny the request and his/her decision shall be final.

B. The district shall provide, free of charge, a place for the hearing.

C. The district shall provide, free of charge, the necessary clerical assistance and shall pay the necessary miscellaneous costs of the hearing.

D. For any appeal hearing, the district agrees to release employees without loss in compensation up to a single complainant and up to two (2) witnesses, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the parties.

E. The district shall provide for a record of the hearing either with an electronic recording or with a court reporter.

Section 13: ABSENCE WITHOUT PERMISSION CONSTITUTING RESIGNATION

Absence from duty without permission for five (5) consecutive workdays shall be deemed a resignation from the district and shall be officially recorded as such. If the absent unit member makes an explanation of the absence that is satisfactory to the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee within twenty-two (22) calendar days following the fifth workday of unauthorized absence, such unit member may be restored to the position.

Section 14: DEMOTION OF PERMANENT/PROBATIONARY UNIT MEMBER

The notice shall state the reason for the recommendation and shall advise the unit member that the unit member may request a hearing with the Director of Classified Personnel to rebut the charges. A request for a meeting shall be filed with the Director of Classified Personnel within five (5) workdays upon receipt of the notice of demotion.
