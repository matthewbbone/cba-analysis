ARTICLE 11. TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT POLICIES

Section 1: INITIATION AND APPROVAL OF TRANSFERS AND REASSIGNMENTS

A. Transfer. A transfer is a voluntary change of a unit member from one site or program to another site or program. A permanent or permanent/probationary unit member may request a transfer within the same job classification or to a different classification.

B. Administrative Reassignment. An administrative reassignment is an involuntary change of assignment of a unit member from one site or program to another site or program. The unit member’s supervisor may initiate an administrative reassignment.

The approval of the Director, Classified Personnel, or his/her designee, is required before a transfer or administrative reassignment is accomplished.

Section 2: TRANSFERS

A. Transfer Process. To receive consideration for a transfer, the unit member must request the transfer in accordance with procedures issued by the Human Resource Services Division. A separate request shall be made for each classification desired.

B. Transfer to different classification. A unit member may request a transfer to a position in a different classification if the position has the same or lower maximum rate of pay and is deemed to be sufficiently related in terms of skills, knowledge, and abilities.

C. Transfer requests. The Human Resource Services Division shall forward to the appropriate supervisor, a list of all unit members in alphabetical order, who have filed a transfer request.

D. Interview by supervisor. Whenever a vacancy is to be filled, the requesting supervisor shall first review, and consider, all pending transfer requests; however, the vacancy may be filled from another source as deemed appropriate by the Director, Classified Personnel.

1. If the supervisor decides to interview eligible candidates, he/she shall interview an equal number of eligible unit members from the appropriate transfer list unless there are not enough transfer requests to match the number of eligible candidates.

2. As soon as possible after completion of the interview and selection process, the supervisor or designee will notify all interviewed transfer and eligible unit member candidates as to whether or not they were selected.

Section 3: ADMINISTRATIVE REASSIGNMENT

A. The unit member’s supervisor may request an administrative reassignment when he/she deems a reassignment would be in the best interest of the unit member or the District. The supervisor must meet with the unit member to discuss the proposed reassignment. The reasons for the reassignment shall not be arbitrary or capricious.
