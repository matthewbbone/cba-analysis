ARTICLE 14. UNIT MEMBER DISCIPLINE
(continued)

Section 4: APPEAL FROM SUSPENSION

A permanent unit member who has been suspended may request a hearing before a hearing officer by following the procedure in Section 8. The hearing shall be conducted as provided for in Section 9. The decision of the hearing officer in each case shall be final.

Section 5: SUSPENSION DUE TO ACCUSATION OF CRIME

Upon the filing of a complaint, information, or indictment that a permanent unit member has committed any serious or violent crime, the Superintendent of Public Education may recommend to the Board of Education the suspension of the unit member without pay. The period of the recommended suspension shall not extend for more than ten (10) calendar days after the date the court judgment is entered. The unit member shall be provided a written statement of the reason for the suspension within three (3) workdays after being notified of the suspension. The statement shall be equivalent to a written accusation specified in Section 6 of this Article.

The unit member shall be subject to loss of pay for the period of the suspension unless the court adjudges the unit member not guilty, or unless the complaint, information, or indictment is dismissed. In such a case, the district shall pay the unit member’s full compensation for the period of the suspension provided the unit member notifies the district of the disposition of the case and returns to service immediately. A unit member suspended pursuant to this paragraph may be subject to further action under this Article upon disposition of the criminal case against the unit member.

Any unit member suspended pursuant to this Section shall continue to receive the unit member’s regular salary during the period of the suspension if the unit member furnishes the district with a suitable bond or other security acceptable to the Governing Board. The bond or security is a guarantee that the unit member will repay the district the amount of salary received during the period of the suspension if the employee is convicted of the charges or fails or refuses to return to service following an acquittal or dismissal of the charges. If the unit member is acquitted of the offense or the charges are dismissed, the district will reimburse the unit member for the cost of the bond upon the unit member’s return to service with the district.

Section 6: DEMOTION OR DISMISSAL

For any of the causes enumerated in Section 1 of this Article, the Superintendent of Public Education may recommend to the Board of Education that a permanent employee be demoted or dismissed. The Superintendent of Public Education, when recommending such demotion or dismissal, shall file a written accusation with the Board of Education. The written accusation will be sufficiently definite to enable the accused unit member to prepare a defense on the merits of the case.
