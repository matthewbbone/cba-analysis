ARTICLE 7. WAGES
(continued)

Section 2: ADDITIONAL FUNDS

A. Contingency. In the event that the District receives additional new state funds not covered in Section 1. and not precluded in Section 2. of this Article, the Contract Administration Committee shall meet, as necessary, to review and discuss the allocation of these funds to the various budget categories, including unit member salaries. Additional funds subject to this Section include:

New funds received by the District from the State which are noncategorical, nonrestrictive, not based on ADA growth, not from proceeds of the lottery, and do not represent a reimbursement of expenditures made by the District during the current or prior years and are not a conversion of one category of income received in the prior year to another category of income in the current year.

B. Non-grievability. Salary increases, if any, provided as a result of the Contract Administration Committee's deliberation are specifically excluded from Article 15 Grievance Procedure.

Section 3: RETROACTIVE COMPENSATION

Compensation paid pursuant to this Article shall be paid only to unit members who are officially employed by the San Diego Unified School District at the time of Board of Education adoption of the 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 salary schedules, respectively, and to unit members who retire or are laid off between July 1 and the date of Board adoption in the applicable year.

Section 4: MILEAGE

Approved mileage reimbursement for bargaining unit members will be the current applicable Internal Revenue Service rate.

Section 5: UNDERPAYMENTS OR OVERPAYMENTS

Each unit member is encouraged to review their annual salary placement and to examine all pay warrants carefully. If an incorrect salary placement has been made or an individual pay warrant is in error, this information must be brought to the attention of the District immediately. Overpayments and underpayments are not subject to the accumulation of earned interest. If an incorrect salary placement or warrant results in an underpayment, the District shall, within five workdays following such determination, provide the unit member with a written statement of the correction and issue a supplemental pay warrant for the amount due. Board of Education By-Laws limit the time period for submitting claims due to underpayment of wages to one (1) year from the date the underpayment began. If the incorrect placement or warrant results in an overpayment, the District is required to recover the full amount overpaid. The District will provide the unit member with a written, detailed description of the overpayment including the calculations. The recovery schedule for the overpayment will include consideration to both the District and the unit member.
