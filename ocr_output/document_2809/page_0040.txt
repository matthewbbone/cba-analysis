Section 6: GENERAL

A. Benefits of the San Diego City Schools Dental Benefits Plan referred to in Section 3 will be district-funded. The district-funded benefit fund will be subject to full guarantees as to its separate integrity from other district funds, and the fund shall be subject to audit by the internal auditor, independent district contract auditors, and the County auditor/controller.

The Board of Education, as an elected body, shall provide for the management and control of the funds as a public trust. Either Party may request a quarterly meeting for audit review purposes.

B. Medical, dental, and/or vision records of unit members and their dependents relating to benefit claims shall be maintained only in the offices of the medical, dental, or vision providers/carriers or third party administrators contracted to provide claims processing and review services.

C. Under the medical, dental, and vision plans provided under this Contract, each spouse can cover the other as a dependent provided they are both employee members of the plan. Dependent children may be covered as dependents under both parents.

D. A mutually agreed-upon claims processing company shall be selected to process claims under the self-funded dental plan of the District.

E. Unit members and unit members on leave of absence enrolled in the medical plans referred to in Section 2 or the dental plans referred to in Section 3 may elect to change plans only during the annual open enrollment period in November. Retirees, surviving dependents, and unit members on layoff enrolled in the medical plans referred to in Section 2 or the dental plans referred to in Section 3 may elect to change plans only during the annual open enrollment period in November.

F. The benefits described in this Article are governed by the official plan documents associated with each benefit plan.

G. A spouse of a deceased unit member or a retiree (who was receiving a monthly benefit under the State Teachers' Retirement System or Public Employees Retirement System at the time of his or her death) may continue participation in the medical and dental plans referred to in Sections 2 and 3. To qualify under this provision, all of the following requirements must be met:

2. The spouse must notify the Employee Services Department within thirty-one (31) days of the date when coverage would normally terminate that coverage should be continued.

3. Required contributions must be received by the Employee Services Department at the time the request for the continuation of coverage is made. Coverage may be retained by the spouse until remarriage by paying the required contributions to the District.

H. Unit members who are separated due to a reduction in force may continue their group medical coverage for up to eighteen (18) calendar months from the date coverage would have normally terminated by paying the required fee to the District (COBRA).
