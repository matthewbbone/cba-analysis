j. Concurrency with Sick Leave and Vacation. All Family Care Leave is unpaid. The exceptions are that:

(1) A unit member may elect or the District may require the unit member to utilize accrued vacation in lieu of unpaid status; and

(2) If the unit member is taking Family Care Leave due to his/her own illness, the unit member may elect, or the District may require the unit member to utilize accrued sick leave hours for Family Care Leave in lieu of unpaid status.

k. Seniority Rights. Unit members shall continue to accrue seniority while on leave.

l. Health and Welfare Benefits. The District shall continue to provide the health and welfare benefits as provided in Article 9 during the Family Care Leave to a unit member who is otherwise eligible for such benefits. However, a unit member who fails to return from such leave or who works less than thirty (30) days after returning from the leave will be required to reimburse the District for the cost of the benefits package unless the reason the unit member does not return to work is due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that would entitle the unit member to additional Family Care Leave (either affecting the unit member or the unit member’s child, spouse, domestic partner, or parent) or other circumstances beyond the control of the unit member. The District, however, will not provide such health benefits for a unit member for any leave period beyond twelve (12) weeks unless these benefits are specified by other provisions of this Agreement such as paid illness leave.

D. The unit member will retain any prior sick leave accumulated, but will not accumulate additional sick leave rights during the unpaid leave of absence.
