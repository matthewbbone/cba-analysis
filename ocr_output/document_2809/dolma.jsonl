Unit members other than those referred to in Sections 6.A.2 and 6.A.3 will be compensated at one and one-half times the equivalent hourly rate of pay for the unit member's job class and salary grade step as contained in this schedule. Unit members will be compensated at two (2) times the equivalent hourly rate of pay for the unit member's job class and salary grade step as contained in this schedule for work performed on any seventh (7th) consecutive workday where the unit member has worked hours on the six (6) preceding calendar days entitling him/her to compensation. Only the seventh (7th) consecutive workday will entitle the unit member to double time. All other workdays will be paid in accordance with the existing rules and regulations contained in this salary schedule.\n\nE. Overtime of less than six (6) minutes. Overtime worked in units of less than six (6) minutes will be disregarded for purposes of compensation.\n\nF. Work On Holidays. Work performed by regular unit members on the date of observance scheduled on the District's Master Calendar for any legal or declared holiday enumerated in Article 12, Leave Policies, will be considered as overtime without regard to the number of hours worked on other days of that week and will be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the unit member's regular rate of pay for nonexempt unit members and one (1) times the unit member's regular rate for exempt unit members. Such holiday pay will be in addition to the unit member's regular compensation for the holiday.\n\nG. Overtime Compensation for Special Pay Additive(s). Compensation for overtime will include any special pay additive(s) and may be in the form of payment by warrant or compensatory time off of equivalent value to such payment. Compensatory time off records should be maintained in the appropriate department/site office and such time off shall be permitted within a reasonable time following the day on which overtime is worked, otherwise, the unit member shall be paid by warrant. To the extent possible, ordinary overtime work and method of compensation (either overtime pay or compensatory time off) shall be by mutual agreement between the unit member and supervisor.\n\nSection 7: SPECIAL PAY ADDITIVES\n\nA. Shift Differential. A unit member assigned to work a regular, continuing schedule of four (4) hours per day or more in which four (4) hours or more of such regular shift are worked before 8 a.m. or after 6 p.m. is entitled to shift differential pay. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.\n\nB. Hazard Pay Differential. A unit member will receive a hazard pay differential for assignment to a position designated by the Board of Education as a hazard pay position. A hazard pay position is one which: (1) continuously exposes the unit member to a specific and significant hazard, (2) is clearly dangerous to the health or well being of any unit member so assigned, and (3) the hazard is atypical of the basic occupation or job class. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.\nC. Bilingual/Biliterate Differential. A unit member will receive a bilingual/biliterate differential for assignment to a position designated by the Board of Education as requiring the ability to communicate orally and/or in writing with non-English speaking adults or in sign language with deaf or hard-of-hearing adults for an average of one (1) hour per day. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary. Unit members who believe they are eligible for this differential shall be entitled to submit a Position Classification Review Form to the Human Resource Services Division in accordance with applicable district procedures.\n\nD. Split Shift Differential. A unit member employed to work a regular continuing schedule of more than six (6) hours per day and with a scheduled lunch break of more than two and one-half (2 \u00bd) hours is entitled to a split shift differential. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.\n\nE. Longevity Stipends. Effective July 1, 2001, a unit member in an active monthly bargaining unit assignment as of October 1, of each year will receive an annual lump sum longevity stipend in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Years of Qualifying Monthly District Service Completed</th>\n    <th>Annual Lump Sum Stipend</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>8 through 9</td>\n    <td>$145.24</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>10 through 13</td>\n    <td>$290.48</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>14 through 18</td>\n    <td>$580.94</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>19 or more</td>\n    <td>$1,161.89</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nLongevity stipends are subject to the same percentage increase(s) by which the salary schedule is increased as set forth in Article 7, Section I.\n\nF. Community Based Instruction Differential. A unit member classified as Instructional Assistant (Special Education) will receive a pay differential for assignment to a position which requires continuing and regular Community Based Instruction (CBI) responsibilities as part of the approved program curriculum. CBI is an activity requiring the unit member to accompany one (1) or more students in the community for the purpose of teaching life skills. Such differential will amount to placement on the step of the next higher full salary grade which is approximately five percent (5%) above the unit member's regular salary.\nARTICLE 7. WAGES\nSection 7 (continued)\n\nG. Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Differential. The Union and the District acknowledge the additional skills and services provided by Educational Interpreters who possess certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), and therefore agree to establish an RID differential. This differential will be paid with funds previously used for compensating substitute/hourly interpreters. A RID-certified unit member classified as Educational Interpreter II or Educational Interpreter III will receive a pay differential if assigned duties which require certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. Duties which require such certification are those where interpreting services involve officials from law enforcement and/or Child Protective Services. The unit member\u2019s immediate supervisor must authorize the performance of such duties. The differential will be paid in increments of one (1) hour for each full or partial hour worked requiring RID certification. Such differential will amount to placement on the next higher salary grade which is approximately ten percent (10%) above the unit member's regular salary.\n\nSection 8: INITIAL PLACEMENT ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE\n\nA. Position Class. A unit member will be placed in the job class appropriate to the assigned position.\n\nB. Experience Step. A unit member new to the District will be placed on Step \"A\" of the appropriate salary grade. The Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, may authorize a higher step placement within the appropriate grade for an especially well-qualified individual in a job class for which qualified candidates are found to be in short supply. In such instances, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, will provide written notification to the Union.\n\nSection 9: SERVICE INCREMENTS\n\nA. Assignment of Four (4) or More Hours Per Day. A unit member in a regular monthly assignment of four (4) hours or more per day will be granted a one (1) step salary increase on his/her annual anniversary date as established in accordance with the collective negotiations contract until the \u201cE.5\u201d Step is reached.\n\nB. Assignment of Less Than Four (4) Hours Per Day. A unit member in a regular monthly assignment of less than four (4) hours per day will be placed on the \"A\" Step of the appropriate salary grade and will be granted a one-half (1/2) step salary increase (approximately two and one-half percent [2.5%]) on the anniversary date of his/her employment/promotion until the \u201cD.5\u201d Step is reached. Advancement beyond the \"D.5\" Step is limited to unit members in regular monthly assignments of four (4) or more hours per day. The anniversary date will be established in the same manner as defined in the collective negotiations contract.\nARTICLE 7. WAGES\nSection 9 (continued)\n\nC. Assignment Change From Less Than Four (4) Hours to Four (4) or More Hours Per Day.\nWhen an unit member's assignment is increased from less than four (4) hours per day to four (4) or more hours per day, the anniversary date will not change and unit members who have not reached Step \"D.5\" will receive a one (1) step salary increase on the next scheduled anniversary date as established in Section 9.1. Unit members on Step \"D.5\" will advance to Step \"E.5\" on their next anniversary date.\n\nD. Assignment Change from Four (4) or More Hours to Less than Four (4) Hours Per Day.\nWhen a unit member's assignment is decreased from four (4) or more hours per day to less than four (4) hours per day the anniversary date will not change and unit members who have not reached the \"D.5\" Step will receive a one-half (1/2) step salary increase on the next scheduled anniversary date as established in Section 9.B. Unit members on Step \"E\" or \"E.5\" remain on that step.\n\nE. Merit Increments. A regular monthly unit member eligible for service increments in accordance with Section 8.1 and who is assigned to an exempt job class (those not eligible for premium overtime pay) and whose work performance is deemed to be outstanding may be granted a one (1) step salary increase at any time upon recommendation of the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, and approval by the Board of Education. In such instances, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, will provide written notification to the Union. When such a merit increment has been granted, a new anniversary or annual increment due date will be established if such placement is at a step less than the maximum for the job class.\n\nSection 10: HOURLY AND DAILY PAY CALCULATIONS\n\nHourly pay rates for regular classified unit members on monthly salaries and for temporary unit members assigned to job classes on the regular classified salary schedule are determined by dividing the monthly rates by 173.33. (This divisor is an industry-wide norm which represents the average number of working hours in the work month.) Daily pay rates are determined by multiplying the hourly rates by the number of regular hours assigned per workday.\n\nSection 11: PART-MONTH PAY CALCULATIONS AND DEDUCTIONS FOR MONTHLY PAID POSITIONS\n\nA. A newly hired unit member will have the initial monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. A terminating unit member will have the terminal monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. Pay so determined for that month will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate.\n\nB. A unit member who is promoted or demoted other than on the first workday of the month will have the pay for that month prorated on the basis of the number of days worked in the month in each job class. In this instance only, the daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly salary by the number of potential workdays in the month including mandated and declared holidays.\nC. Salary reductions for all unpaid time in accordance with negotiated contracts and district policy and procedure will involve a reduction in pay at the unit member's daily rate for each day of absence. Total reductions so determined will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate. No pay will be drawn when such days missed involve a full calendar month regardless of the number of workdays in that month. Salary reductions for fifty percent (50%) sick leave will be at one-half (1/2) of the unit member's daily rate.\n\nD. An unit member changing mid-year from a conventional work year schedule to a year-round schedule (or vice versa) will have the conventional assignment pay calculation (based on the mid-month promotion rule above) and the year-round pay calculation (based on a daily rate) completed so as to result in equal monthly payments for the remainder of the school year.\n\nThe initial pay in the new assignment will be a balancing payment. Year-round classified unit member monthly rates are determined in the following manner: 1) The number of days of service in the traditional work year for the job class is multiplied by the daily rate, determined in accordance with the daily pay calculation method (monthly rate/173.33) X 8, to determine an annual salary. 2) Inasmuch as the year-round assignment has the same number of paid days, the annual salary so determined is divided by twelve (12) to establish the year-round monthly rate.\n\nSection 12: COMPENSATION FOR WORKSHOP PARTICIPATION\n\nThe California or federal minimum wage rate (whichever is higher) applies to regular monthly classified unit members of the San Diego Unified School District who participate in workshops at the request of the District. This rate will be paid only for workshop participation outside the unit member's normal workdays and/or hours. Such qualifying workshop participation will be paid at the straight or overtime workshop participation rate in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.\n\nUnit members who are required to attend workshops at the request of the District will be paid at their regular straight or overtime rate of pay in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.\n\nSection 13: UNIT MEMBERS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN SALARY SCHEDULES\n\nA unit member transferring between salary schedules will be placed and continued in employment in accordance with the rules and regulations of the salary schedule to which the unit member is transferring without regard to the basis for such transfer (promotion, demotion, etc.).\nARTICLE 7. WAGES\n(continued)\n\nSection 14: PROMOTION\n\nA. Promotion From Another Classified Salary Schedule: A unit member who is promoted from a position on another classified unit members' salary schedule to a position on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule with a higher maximum salary will first have his/her salary determined in the appropriate grade of the other classified salary schedule in accordance with existing regulations and then will be paid at the rate in the appropriate salary grade on either salary schedule which would provide an approximate five percent (5%) increase (exclusive of special pay additives) but not more than seven and one-half percent (7.5%) increase. In no case shall the salary step placement exceed the maximum for the appropriate salary grade. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.\n\nB. Promotion Within Paraeducator Salary Schedule. A unit member who is promoted from one job class on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule to a higher job class will be placed on the step of the higher salary grade which is at least one full salary grade or approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half [7.5%]) in amount above the unit member's salary exclusive of special pay additives at the time of promotion. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.\n\nC. Next Service Increment. If a service increment is not immediately due at the time of promotion to a higher job class, it will be granted in the higher job class on the same date it would have been granted in the lower job class. If a service increment is not due at the time of promotion to a higher job class because the unit member has already reached the maximum step on the salary grade of the lower job class, a new service increment due date will be effective on the anniversary date (first day of the month in the month promoted for unit members promoted between the first [1st] and fifteenth [15th] of the month; first [1st] day of the month following the month promoted for unit members promoted on or after the sixteenth [16th] of the month), and additional service increments due will be granted beginning one (1) year thereafter until the maximum salary for the job class is reached.\n\nD. A unit member who voluntarily accepts a demotion and who is promoted to the former higher job class within thirty-six (36) months will be placed on the step of the appropriate salary grade that was held prior to such demotion.\n\nE. Temporary Out-Of Class Assignments. A unit member temporarily assigned to perform higher level duties not reasonably consistent with those prescribed for the regular job class for more than four (4) workdays within a fifteen (15) calendar-day period will receive an upward salary adjustment. The salary adjustment will be effective for the entire period of such temporary assignment. The amount of the adjustment will be the same as would be provided by the regular promotional rules as determined by Director, Classified Personnel.\nSection 15: PLACEMENT IN LOWER JOB CLASS\n\nA. Demotions Due to Unit member Request or Disciplinary Reasons. When a permanent unit member is placed in a position in a lower job class in the same type of work at the unit member's own request or if a permanent unit member is demoted in accordance with The Employment Regulations for the Classified Service of the San Diego Unified School, the salary step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be that which is approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half percent [7.5%]) in amount below the unit member's salary in the higher class. Unit members who reach the maximum step in the higher class or on a step in the higher class which is more than seven and one-half (7.5%) above the maximum step of the lower job class will be placed on the maximum step of the lower class. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum salary for the lower job class has been achieved. If the reassignment is to a position in a lower job class with a different type of work the step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be at the same dollar rate. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade, the unit member will be placed on the step that will result in the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate.\n\nB. Demotions Due to Classification Review or in Lieu of Layoff. When a permanent unit member is reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position, or demoted in lieu of layoff, or for some other reasons in the district's best interest, the unit member will be placed on the step at the same dollar rate, exclusive of any special pay additive, if such rate appears in the lower salary grade. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the demotion is from a half grade to a whole grade, or vice versa, the unit member's salary will be changed to the step which provides the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum for the lower job class has been achieved. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the maximum rate is less than the unit member's current pay rate, the unit member's salary, exclusive of any special pay additive, will be maintained as it was prior to demotion for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months unless the maximum for the lower job class is changed to exceed the previously achieved salary. At the end of the eighteen (18) month period, the salary will be changed to the maximum for the lower job class. A permanent unit member so protected and who is assigned on a temporary basis, for up to ninety (90) calendar days, to a position in the job class from which he/she was demoted in lieu of layoff will be placed on the same salary step of the range for his/her job class as that held at the time of demotion. When such temporarily reassigned unit member is again moved to the lower job class, he/she will receive the same dollar rate as was originally protected and the original eighteen (18) month period will be extended for each month or major fraction thereof during which the unit member was temporarily promoted.\n\nC Reemployment Rights for Unit Members reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position will be determined in the same manner as in Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment, Sections 8 and 9.\nARTICLE 7. WAGES\nSection 15 (continued)\n\nD. When a probationary unit member is reassigned to a position in a lower job class for any reason, the step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be determined in the same manner as in Section 15.A.\n\nE. When a probationary unit member is permanent in a job class on a lower salary grade in the same occupational field and is reassigned to a position in a job class lower than the highest held permanent position in that occupational field due to demotion in lieu of layoff the salary protection rights in the highest held permanent position in that occupational field shall be determined in accordance with the provisions in Section 15.B.\n\nSection 16: CLASSIFICATION STUDY\n\nA unit member may request a classification study of his/her position by completing a Position Classification Review Form, obtaining all necessary signatures, and forwarding the request to the Human Resource Services Division in accordance with the timelines specified in District procedure 7540. Classification studies are excluded from the grievance procedure.\nARTICLE 8. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT\n\nSection 1: WORKDAY AND WORKWEEK\n\nA. The District recognizes the principle of an eight (8) hour workday and a forty (40) hour workweek for unit members employed on a full-time basis.

The unit member\u2019s supervisor shall establish the unit member\u2019s work schedule at the time of initial employment. A change in the work schedule is defined as the modification of a unit member\u2019s starting and/or ending time of a workday. The work schedule may be changed under the following circumstances:\n\n1. When mutually agreed to by the unit member and the supervisor.\n\n2. When a unit member is given a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days written notice prior to the effective date of a permanent change in work schedule, or five (5) workdays written notice for a temporary change in work schedule.\n\nB. In the event of an emergency the supervisor may modify/change the work schedule.\n\nC. The unit member\u2019s supervisor will discuss, with the unit member, any problems affecting the implementation of work schedule changes.\n\nD. Unit members may be temporarily exempt from a permanent change in work schedule providing the unit member verifies enrollment in a course in an institution of higher education or verifies childcare issues which conflict with the proposed work schedule change and which cannot be rescheduled at a time compatible with the proposed work schedule.\n\nE. A unit member\u2019s work schedule shall not be changed temporarily to avoid the payment of split shift or night shift differentials.\nARTICLE 8. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT\n(continued)\n\nSection 3: INCREASES IN ASSIGNED TIME\n\nThe District retains the right to increase the assigned workday or work year for unit members, in accordance with the following procedures:\n\nA. Whenever the District increases the workday or work year of a position, it shall offer such increases to unit members who hold the positions being increased.\n\nB. In the event the incumbent who holds the position declines an offer of an increase to his/her workday or work year, other unit members in the same classification at that site may request the increase in hours and shall meet with the selecting administrator and be considered for the position first, before all others.\n\nC. Prior to permanent increases in the workday or work year, unit members will be provided at least thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice of the change. Exceptions may be made in emergencies or by mutual agreement of the unit member and the supervisor.\n\nD. The District may temporarily assign a unit member to a work schedule not routinely worked by such unit member for a maximum of thirty (30) workdays unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the unit member and the supervisor. A unit member shall not be required to accept such assignment unless notified five (5) workdays prior to the effective date of the work schedule change.\n\nSection 4: LUNCH PERIODS\n\nA. Each unit member assigned for more than five (5) hours per day shall be entitled to an unpaid duty-free lunch period of thirty (30) minutes. Taking into consideration the unit member's preference and needs of the program/assignment, unit members who work more than five (5) hours, but less than six (6) hours per day, may waive their lunch period upon mutual agreement of the supervisor and the unit member.\n\nB. Unit members shall not be assigned standby or other duty during the lunch period and are free to leave the work location during the lunch period.\n\nC.

If the unit member's duty free lunch period is interrupted concerning work-related matters, the unit member shall be entitled to extend his/her lunch period by the same amount of time resulting from the interruption.\n\nE. Times when unit members may take their unpaid duty free lunch periods shall be determined by the unit member's supervisor taking unit members' preferences and program/assignment needs into consideration. Normally, the lunch period shall be as close to the middle of the shift as feasible.\nARTICLE 8. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT\nSection 4.E. (continued)\n\nExceptions:\n\nSpecific positions may be assigned to work a straight shift, including a paid lunch period, at the request of the department head and with the approval of the Union.\n\nSection 5: REST BREAKS\n\nA.

Unit members assigned for six (6) hours or more shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) minute paid duty free rest break approximately midway through the work period preceding the lunch period and again approximately midway through the work period succeeding the lunch period.\n\nB. Times when unit members may take their rest periods shall be determined by the unit member\u2019s supervisor taking unit member preferences and program/assignment needs into consideration. Unit members shall not leave the work site during rest breaks without permission in advance from their supervisors.\n\nSection 6: SHORTENING OF THE ASSIGNED WORKDAY\n\nUnless mutually agreed between the unit member and the supervisor, unit members shall not be permitted to shorten their workday by foregoing rest breaks and/or lunch periods.\n\nSection 7: EARLY CALL-IN\n\nA. Occasionally, scheduled activities or unanticipated events may require early call-in of staff. Normally, a unit member called in to work early shall remain on duty until his/her regularly scheduled check-out time. A unit member may request permission to leave work early upon completion of his/her regularly assigned number of hours per day. Unit members shall be compensated for any overtime worked as a result of an early call-in in accordance with the overtime provisions in Article 7, Wages, Section 6, of this Contract. When unit members have been called in at irregular times, they should confer with their supervisors and arrive at a mutually acceptable schedule for the following shift(s).\n\nB. Supervisors shall inform the unit members if they are being requested for an early call-in or a change in work schedule.\n\nSection 8: CALL BACK\n\nA unit member who is required to return to duty after leaving such duty station for the day or week will be compensated for a minimum of three (3) hours.

The District reserves the right to assign overtime to any unit member and to compensate unit members for overtime worked in accordance with Article 7, Wages, Section 6. Under normal circumstances, unit members will be given twenty-four (24) hours advance notice of the need to work overtime. In emergencies, this advance notice will not be required. To the extent possible, ordinary overtime work and the method of compensation (either overtime pay or compensatory time off) shall be by mutual agreement between the unit member and the supervisor.\n\nB. When it is not practical or feasible to supplement the existing trained personnel in key jobs with temporary or redirected personnel, the District may mandate overtime in these key jobs for extended periods of time. The supervisor or designee must approve peak period overtime.\n\nC. Except in an emergency, unit members will not normally be assigned overtime if they have used sick leave on the same workday that the overtime work is available.\n\nD. When compensatory time is agreed upon, the unit members shall be provided the opportunity to take such time off within six (6) months of accrual. If a unit member requests to take compensatory time off and the request is not granted during the six (6) month period, the unit member shall be paid for the accrued compensatory time.

Less-than-effective performance evaluation reports shall be based upon information which is supported by documentation.\n\nC.

On or before the first (1st) day of July of the year in which a term expires, or as often as vacancies shall occur, nominations for appointment as an expedited arbitrator shall be made in rotation by the presiding judge of the Superior Court of the County of San Diego and the President of the Civil Service Commission of the City of San Diego. Both the District and the Union must approve nominations.\n\n2. No person appointed as an expedited arbitrator may be an employee of the District at any time during his/her term of office.\n\n3.

The arbitrator shall have the obligation of assuring that all necessary facts and considerations are brought before him/her by the representatives of the Parties.\n\n6. If the arbitrator or the Parties conclude at the hearing that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to require further consideration by the Parties, the case shall be referred back to the appropriate place in the grievance procedure.\n\n7. The arbitrator shall either make an oral/bench award or issue a decision within five (5) workdays after conclusion of the Hearing. The arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be based on the records developed by the Parties before and at the hearing and shall include a brief written explanation of the basis for his/her conclusion. These decisions shall not be cited as precedent in any discussion at any step of the grievance or arbitration procedure. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding.\n\n8. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this Contract but shall determine only whether or not there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Contract as alleged by the grievant or grievants.\n\n9. The arbitrator shall have the power to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Contract or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Contract depends. The arbitrator may not decide any issue not submitted and may not interpret or apply the Contract so as to change what can fairly be said to have been the intent of the Parties as determined by generally accepted rules of contract construction. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award merely because, in the arbitrator\u2019s opinion, such decision or award is fair and equitable.\n\n10. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented by the Parties in the presence of each other.\n\n11. No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the beginning of the last payroll period prior to the fifteen (15) workday period for filing a grievance specified in Level Two of this grievance procedure.

If a grievance is not resolved at Level Three, the Union may request a hearing before an arbitrator. The request shall be filed in the Human Resource Services Division within fifteen (15) workdays after the written decision of the division representative becomes effective. Grievances which have been heard under the provisions of Section 6, Expedited Arbitration, are ineligible for appeal to Level Six of this procedure.\n\nB. Within five (5) workdays after receipt of a request for arbitration, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee and the Union agree to meet and review the pending arbitration case. If no agreement is reached, the District shall request the State Mediation and Conciliation Service to supply a list of seven (7) arbitrators.

The arbitrator shall have the power to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Contract or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Contract depends. The arbitrator may not decide any issue not submitted and may not interpret or apply the Contract so as to change what can fairly be said to have been the intent of the Parties as determined by generally accepted rules of contract construction. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award merely because, in the arbitrator's opinion, such decision or award is fair and equitable.\n\n4. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented by the Parties in the presence of each other and upon arguments presented in briefs.\n\n5. No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the beginning of the last payroll period prior to the fifteen (15) workday period for filing a grievance specified in Level Two of this grievance procedure.

The decision of the arbitrator under Section 6, Expedited Arbitration, or Section 7, Binding Arbitration, is not appealable by either Party except as provided in this Section and, unless so appealed, shall be the full, complete and final resolution of the grievance and implemented in accordance with these terms.\nARTICLE 15. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\nSection 8. (continued)\n\nB. Either the Union or the District may appeal the arbitrator's decision to a court of competent jurisdiction within twenty (20) workdays of such decision on either or both of the following grounds, which the Parties intend to include within their interpretation and understanding of Code Of Civil Procedure Sections 1286.2, 1286.4 and 1286.6:\n\n1. Where another remedy has been provided by law which leads to a different result than that reached by the arbitrator, and in which event it shall be deemed that the arbitrator exceeded his/her powers under this Contract.\n\n2. Where the arbitrator's decision is contrary to any of the provisions of Section 6, Subparagraphs D.8 through D.11 or Section 7, subparagraphs D.1 through D.5, respectively, or any of them, of this Contract, it shall be deemed to be arbitrator misconduct and/or that the arbitrator has exceeded his/her powers under the Contract.\n\n3. In addition to Section 8, Level Seven, A. and B. above, any award made by an arbitrator under the provisions of this Contract may be corrected or enforced pursuant to Civil Code Section 1285 et seq., except that, where a shorter time is specified in this Contract to commence a court proceeding than is given under the Code of Civil Procedure, the shorter time of this Contract shall control.\n\nC. Failure of either Party to commence a court action within the period indicated herein, shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal and the decision of the arbitrator shall become final and non-appealable.\n\nSection 9: GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nA. A bargaining unit member involved in the filing of a grievance shall be provided such conference time for meeting with a union staff representative, union steward or other representative as defined in Article 3, Section 2, without loss of time, pay, or benefits.\n\nB.

Conferences specified at Level One and Level Two may also be waived by mutual agreement.\n\nG Any grievance not appealed to the next level of the procedure within the prescribed time limits shall be considered settled on the basis of the answer given in the preceding level.\n\nH. If the District does not render a written response within the limits set forth at any level of the proceedings, the grievant may advance to the next level.\n\nI. By mutual agreement of the Union and the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, grievances involving an action by an administrator above the level of principal or department head may be filed at Level Three.\n\nJ.

In the event a unit member exercises his/her right to present a grievance without the intervention of the Union, any resolution of the grievance shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Contract, nor shall the District agree to the resolution until the Union has received a copy of the grievance and of the proposed resolution and has been given five (5) workdays to file a response.\n\nP. No grievance shall be filed by a unit member after the effective date of separation from the District.\nARTICLE 15. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\n(continued)\n\nSection 10: INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS\n\nThe provisions of this Article shall not apply to the provisions of a contract/plan document relating to the health and welfare benefits plans provided under Article 9. Such issues shall be resolved through the complaint resolution procedure which is a part of each plan.\nARTICLE 16. ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY\n\nSection 1: DUES DEDUCTIONS\n\nAny unit member who is a member of the Union, or who applies for membership, may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of membership dues and such other mutually agreed payroll deductions as may be offered by the Union. Such authorization shall continue from year to year, unless revoked by the individual for the duration of this contract. Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall implement a twelve (12) month dues deduction schedule in accordance with parameters established by the Union.\n\nSection 2: ESTABLISHMENT OF DUES SCHEDULE\n\nThe Union may determine the dues schedule for all members of the Union. Changes to the dues schedule may be made by the Union without necessitating a new dues deduction authorization from any current member. The Union will give the District thirty (30) days advance notice of any changes in the dues schedule.\n\nSection 3: PAYMENT OF MONIES\n\nWith respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization by the unit member, the District agrees to remit such monies without cost to the Union, within seven (7) workdays, accompanied by an alphabetical listing of the unit members for whom such deductions have been made. This list will include unit member\u2019s name, social security number, payroll number, site location, deduction amount.\n\nSection 4: FAIR SHARE PROVISION\n\nA. Any unit member who is not a member of the Union, or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30) days of the operative date of this Section or within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, whichever occurs later, shall:\n\n1. Become a member of the Union through payroll deduction or pay the annual dues in one (1) lump sum payment to the Union, or\n\n2. Pay a service fee, the amount of which is determined by the Union and authorized by Section 3540.1(i)(2) of the Government Code and consistent with legal requirements, provided that it shall be the sole responsibility of the Union to ensure that such fee is legally determined and legally appropriate. The fee shall be paid through payroll deduction or may be paid in one (1) lump sum payment to the Union, or\n\n3. Request exemption status from the Union based on philosophical or religious objections (see Section 5 below). The amount equivalent to the fee described above in Section A.2. must be paid to a non-religious, non-labor charitable organization which is exempt from Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code. The fee may be paid through payroll deduction (if available) or in one (1) lump sum payment to one of the charitable organizations listed below:\nARTICLE 16. ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY\nSection 4.A.3.

In the event a non-member does not pay such fee directly to the Union or qualify as an objector exempt from the fee, the Union shall so inform the District in writing, with a copy to the unit member certifying these facts and the correct amount of the fee owed. The District shall then begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in California Education Code Section 45168.\n\nSection 5: FAIR SHARE EXEMPTIONS\n\nA. Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations or any unit member who has deeply held, long-term philosophical objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support the Union. Such unit members shall apply to the Union for an exemption as described herein. The Union shall develop a process for granting/denying such applications, including appeal rights for applications denied which provide for hearing by a neutral third party.\n\nB. Provided that the Union has no cause to presume a change in the religious/philosophical exemption status of a unit member once an exemption is granted it need not be reviewed on an annual basis. However, proof of payment of the charitable funds, pursuant to this Section, shall be made on an annual basis to the Union as a condition of continued exemption from the provisions of Section 4 above.\n\nC. Proof of payment (in lieu of the service fee) shall be in the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment was made. Such proof shall be presented on or before the date required for a lump sum payment of fair share fees in each school year.\n\nD. Any unit member making charitable contributions as set forth in this Article, and who requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in his/her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures.\nARTICLE 16. ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY\n(continued)\n\nSection 6: PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD (PERB) REGULATIONS\n\nThe Parties recognize that PERB may, from time to time, adopt procedures regulating fair share (agency fees). It is the intent of the Parties that the Union abide by such regulations in the collection of such fair share fees. The Parties further agree that any action to enforce such regulations shall be brought solely by unit member(s) who claim violation of the regulations, and that such actions (if any) shall not interfere with rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Upon request of the unit member, the Union shall provide a copy of the most current set of PERB regulations regarding this subject.\n\nSection 7: HOLD HARMLESS\n\nThe Union agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless the District, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims, losses, and expenses occurring or resulting from the enforcement or challenge to the legality of the provisions of this Article. This hold harmless provision is intended to apply to circumstances involving a third-party challenge to the legality of the provisions of this Article and not to grievances or other disputes between the District and the Union involving the interpretation or implementation of these provisions.\n\nThe Union shall have the authority and right to decide and defend any such action. It shall have the right to determine whether any such litigation shall or shall not be compromised, defended, resisted, tried or appealed. Prior to the exercise of these rights, the Union shall be required to inform and consult with the District.\n\nSection 8: MISCELLANEOUS\n\nA. The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed, or discontinued deduction of membership dues or fair share fees within this Article until the pay period commencing not less than thirty (30) workdays after submission of the form by the unit member or the Union.\n\nB. The Union agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the provisions of this Article. The Union further agrees to provide the District with a timely copy of all reports legally required of the Union dealing with fair share fees.\n\nC. Upon appropriate written authorization from a unit member, who is a member of the Union, the District will deduct from the salary of said unit member and make appropriate remittance for any other plans or programs approved by the Union and the District.\nARTICLE 17.

The unit member shall acknowledge that he/she has read such material by signing and dating the original records, with the understanding that the unit member\u2019s signature signifies only that the material has been read and does not necessarily indicate agreement with its contents.\nARTICLE 17. UNIT MEMBER RIGHTS\nSection 2 (continued)\n\nD. The unit member\u2019s review of such derogatory material and a reasonable amount of time to prepare a written response will take place during normal business hours, and the unit member shall be released from duty without loss of pay for this purpose.\n\nSection 3: NON-DISCRIMINATION\n\nA.

When two or more positions of equal hours and same classification are at the same site, the least senior unit member's position shall be eliminated or reduced, unless a volunteer in that classification is available.\n\nSection 4: DECISION TO LAYOFF\n\nA. Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce hours or layoff unit members for lack of work or lack of funds, the procedure shall be as delineated in this Article. The decision to layoff or reduce hours is solely that of the Board of Education and shall not be bargainable or grievable.

If a tie still exists, the unit member with the most recent initial hire date shall be laid off. Lots will be drawn in the presence of a Union representative to break remaining ties.\n\nC. Whenever a unit member is laid off or reduced in hours, the order of layoff or reduction in hours shall be determined by length of service in the classification, plus service in equal and higher salary grades. The unit member with the least amount of classification seniority plus service in equal and higher salary grades shall be laid off or reduced in hours first. Service in substitute status shall not count toward seniority in the classification. Service in temporary out-of-classification assignments shall not count toward seniority in the classification to which the unit member was temporarily assigned.\n\nSection 7: DISPLACEMENT RIGHTS\n\nA.

If there is no least senior unit member in the same classification who is also required to be bilingual, the unit member may displace the least senior unit member in the same classification who has no language requirement, in accordance with the same displacement rights as specified in Sections 7.A. and 7.B.\n\n2. Other Differentials\n\nUnit members whose positions have been eliminated or reduced shall have the right to displace the least senior unit members in their same classification regardless of whether the least senior unit member is receiving one or more of the differentials listed in Article 7, Section 7, with the exception of the Bilingual Differential.\n\nSection 8: REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS\n\nA. Unit members who are laid off or reduced in hours shall be placed on the reemployment list in order of their classification seniority which shall be in reverse order of layoff. Unit members on this reemployment list shall be recalled prior to the creation of an applicant pool for the classification.

Upon acceptance of reemployment, the unit member shall have five (5) workdays to report for work unless the District agrees to an extension of the reporting date. Such extension shall be solely at the discretion of the District.\n\nD. Should the notice of reemployment be undeliverable or the noticed unit member not accept the offer of reemployment, the unit member's name shall be removed from the reemployment list, and he/she shall be deemed to have resigned from the District.\n\nE. A unit member who is reduced in hours shall have the right to refuse offers of reemployment at the original or greater hours, up to a maximum of three (3) offers, at which time the unit member shall be deemed to have exhausted his/her reemployment rights. Unit members who are reduced in hours and become eligible for reemployment shall be notified by telephone by the Human Resource Services Division and shall have five (5) workdays from receipt of the notice to respond to the offer of reemployment.

In no event shall this work be performed by volunteers, so-called hourly workers, CSW\u2019s or workers in other bargaining units, nor shall any unit member be offered hourly employment in order to avoid being laid off, reduced in hours or displaced. Laid off unit members will not be replaced with CSW\u2019s, and existing bargaining unit positions that become vacant will not be filled with CSW\u2019s. If the District eliminates a bargaining unit position in the future, it shall maintain a record of the position showing its work location.\n\nSection 13: PROHIBITION AGAINST WAIVER OF BENEFITS\n\nThe District shall not encourage or require any unit member to waive health and welfare benefits in order to avoid a layoff or reduction in hours.\nARTICLE 18.

HEATH, State Bar #111582\nCALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION\n2045 Lundy Avenue - Box 640\nSan Jose, CA 95106\n(408) 263-8000 Fax: (408) 954-0948\n\nSUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA\nCOUNTY OF SAN DIEGO\n\nCALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, CHAPTER NO. 759,\nPetitioner,\n\nv.\n\nBOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT,\nRespondent.\n\nCASE NO. 00707784\n\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n\nJudge: Judith McConnell\nDepartment 51\n\nThis settlement agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between the San Diego Unified School District (the District) in order to avoid the expense and risk of further litigation.\n\nThe District confirms that, effective with the spring term of the 1997-98 school year, it will discontinue the designation of employees as Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistants (CCTA's) and will require all existing CCTA's to work within and meet the qualifications for Classroom College Student Workers (CSW's). This does not restrict the District's right to employ workers outside its classified service, provided they fall within a statutory exemption from the classification requirement. Each party acknowledges that the execution of the Agreement does not constitute admission of, or concession to, any argument, premise or position of the other party.\nDEFINITIONS\n\n1. \"Hire date\" means the initial date that the worker was hired by the District in any capacity. If a worker is rehired after resignation, termination or retirement, \"hire date\" means the most recent hire date.\n\n2. \"Position\" means a particular worker's individual assignment, identified by number, site, and whether the position is classified.\n\n3. \"Classification\" means a group of classified positions with the same title performing similar duties within the classified service.\n\n4. \"Classification seniority date\" means the first date on or after the hire date that the worker performed work of the particular classification for the District that did not fall within any express statutory exemption from the classified service.\n\n5. \"Classification seniority\" means current total length of service in the classification from the classification seniority date, plus all seniority in equal and higher-paid classifications.\n\n6. \"District seniority\" means current total length of service from the earliest classification seniority date in any classification.\n\n7. \"College Student Worker\" (CSW), formerly referred to as Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistant (CCTA), means a person who is all of the following:\n   a. employed part time,\n   b. continuously enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited college or university,\n   c. working in a classroom or a similar instructional setting,\n   d. performing classroom duties, and\n   e. under the direct supervision of a classroom teacher.\n\n8. \"Full-time college student\" means a person who, except for the equivalent of summer school, enrolls in and receives credit for a minimum of 12 units of course work per semester or full-time equivalent as defined by the student's accredited college or university.\n9. \"Substitute\" means a person employed for not more than 194 working days, including holidays, sick leave, vacation and other leaves of absence, and who is employed either:\n    a. to replace a classified worker who is temporarily absent from duty, or\n    b. to fill a vacancy in a classified position while the District is engaged in a procedure to hire a permanent worker to fill the vacancy, provided the District does not fill the vacancy with one or more substitutes for more than 60 days.\n\nThese definitions prevail over conflicting definitions in any other agreement between the parties.\n\nTERMS\n\nReassignment of Seniority Dates\n\n1. Each party shall appoint an equal number of representatives to a joint committee (the Committee) to implement this agreement. CSEA committee members shall be given reasonable paid released time for the work of the Committee.\n2. The Committee shall identify all paraeducator classified workers currently employed by, on a leave of absence from, or on a reemployment list of the District who were employed by the District outside the classified service for any period of time on or after their hire dates.\n3. The Committee shall identify the reason(s) each such classified worker was excluded from the classified service for any portion of their employment.\n4. The Committee shall verify from District records whether each exclusion from the classified service falls within a statutory exemption from the classification requirement.\n5. In every case where District records are inadequate to support a statutory exemption, the classification seniority date shall be changed to include the period of employment within the classified service.\n6. Once all changes to and additions of classification seniority dates have been made, all workers whose names appear on the revised seniority lists shall be notified and provided a\nten (10)-day period after receipt of adequate notice to appeal the seniority determinations to the Committee.\n\n7. The seniority lists as determined by the Committee following the appeals shall be presumed to be correct.\n\nRestoration of Positions and Hours\n\n8. No work regularly performed within the Unit shall be performed outside the unit except by CSW's or substitutes who fall within the definitions listed in this agreement. The District must maintain and permit CSEA to inspect copies of registration forms and transcripts to prove the number of course units enrolled in and for which credit was received by each CSW each fall and spring semester or equivalent.\n\n9. All hiring and changes of hours of paraeducators, CSW's or substitutes and all layoffs, bumps and transfers of paraeducators shall be controlled by the District's central office, subject to negotiations with CSEA, where applicable, and approval by the Board of Education. No such personnel change shall be approved without identifying the classification and position.\n\n10. Upon request, the District shall furnish CSEA with listings of all paraeducators and CSW's employed by the District showing each worker's classification and position equivalent, if any, and work location. Position numbers will also be furnished when they become available.\n\n11. If a Unit position is reduced or eliminated and the work must continue to be performed, or the work is reinstated, it shall be assigned only to workers in the Unit. In no event shall this work be performed by volunteers, so-called hourly workers, CSW's or workers in other units, nor shall any paraeducator be offered hourly employment in order to avoid being laid off, reduced in hours or displaced. Laid off paraeducators will not be replaced with CSW's, and existing Unit positions that become vacant will not be filled with CSW's. If the District eliminates a Unit position in the future, it shall maintain a record of the\nposition showing its work location.\n\n12. Two percentages shall be used to assist in monitoring compliance with paragraph 11. \"The Unit percentage\" is 55% or the District-wide number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) paraeducator-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total of FTE paraeducator-filled positions and FTE CSW-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher. A FTE paraeducator-filled position is 8 hours per day. A FTE CSW-filled position is 6 hours per day. \"The benefited percentage\" is 55% or the District-wide number of paraeducators who are incumbents of positions assigned 4 hours or more per day as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total number of paraeducators as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher.\n\n13. Upon request, the District shall furnish CSEA with all information relevant to whether the District has met the provisions of paragraph 11, above. For monitoring purposes, the Unit percentage and the benefited percentage, although calculated from District-wide figures, shall be applied to each work location. If in the future either percentage, when calculated from FTE positions or paraeducators at a particular work location, falls below the levels specified in paragraph 13, the parties shall meet upon the request of CSEA to determine the reasons for one or both of the percentages being below the specified levels. The District shall have the burden of demonstrating that, notwithstanding the lower percentage(s), it is in compliance with paragraph 11, above.\n\n14. Classified workers in the Unit who have a classification seniority date changed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall be paid for all wages, benefits and other emoluments of employment lost after December 19, 1995 as a result of their improper exclusion from the District's classified service.\n\n15. The parties agree to meet promptly and attempt to resolve any disputes arising under the Agreement. Nothing will prevent the parties from agreeing upon methods of resolving such disputes short of going to court.\n16. The parties agree to the filing of the Agreement and the dismissal of San Diego Superior Court Case No. 707784. CSEA shall cause this action to be dismissed after ratification of the Agreement by the District's governing board.\n\nBOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nBY: Roy Burchill, Director Human Resources\nDate: 1/28/98\n\nBY: Jose A. Gonzales, General Counsel (Interim)\nDate: 1/30/98\n\nCALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, CHAPTER NO. 759\n\nBY: Joan O'Hara\nJoan O'Hara, President Chapter 759\nDate: 1-13-1998\n\nBY: Howard Lawrence\nHoward Lawrence, Director Organizing\nDate: 6/105/98\n\nBY: John Baird\nJohn Baird, Field Director\nDate: 1/12/98\n\nBY: Judy Foltz\nJudy Foltz, Labor Relations Representative\nDate: 1/12/98\n\nBY: Jim Brown\nJim Brown, Chief Negotiator\nDate: 1-12-97\n\nBY: William C. Heath\nWilliam C. Heath, Deputy Chief Counsel\nJanuary 7, 1998\nGUIDELINES FOR THE REASSIGNMENT OF SENIORITY DATES WITHIN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE (Paraeducator Unit)\n\nGOAL OF RESEARCH: Account for all time served as an hourly employee. Within the rules established below, determine whether the service was consistent with Education Code classified service exemptions and, if not, determine how the service should be applied to seniority within each classification and to district seniority.\n\nGENERAL RULES\n\nThe work histories of all Paraeducator Unit employees will be studied. Included in the review are current supervisors and confidential employees with prior service in the Paraeducator Unit.\n\n2. Many employees have current hire dates that are the same as their seniority dates. Do not exclude these employees as errors have frequently been found in the current hire dates. For work performed from 1974 until the present, the current hire date can be verified (within the month) by examining microfiche payroll records.\n\n3. Do not exclude employees on leaves of absence or reemployment lists.\n\n4. The terms and definitions of the SDUSD/CSEA Agreement settling San Diego Superior Court Case No. 00707784 prevail over conflicting language in these guidelines.\n\nDATES TO BE REASSIGNED\n\n1. Classification seniority date\n2. District seniority date\n\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\n\n1. Departmental files\nTo the extent that a particular department maintains employee files that contain relevant information, such as copies of assignment authorizations or personnel action forms, these files may be helpful in researching seniority dates. Much of the information contained in such files is available elsewhere but is not so easily accessible.\n\n2. Human Resources Services Division file\nA limited amount of information is contained in files in HRSD. These files are useful for documenting separations, original hire dates and original classifications. Beyond that, they have little value.\n\n3. Microfiche pay records\nPayroll information on microfiche does not extend back beyond 1974. The microfiched pay histories will tell if the employee was in paid status and under what group (classified hourly, classified monthly, certificated hourly, food services monthly, food services hourly). Note: The term \"classified hourly\" is an oxymoron used by Payroll. One is either classified or hourly, not both. The microfiche records are helpful in reviewing separations, current hire dates, continuity of service, and to determine prior service in another classification. Microfiche records will rarely tell you where the employee was working while hourly. Generally, all hourly work was reported as location 000 or 998.\n\n4 Employee History (microfiche)\nMicrofiched employee histories provide a comprehensive record of classified assignments of current employees (excludes hourly service). These records are useful in documenting original classification, promotions, demotions, temporary out of class, and layoffs. In addition, the\nrecords show restricted status assignments that have been converted to regular status. The information contained in these records should be verified, where possible, by other documentation (i.e. personnel action forms, assignment authorizations) as errors in status codes and dates have occasionally been found.\n\n5. Mainframe\n\nThe on-line personnel system contains information that is limited to assignments since July 1, 1988, including hourly assignments.\n\n6. Information supplied by the employee\nWhen all other sources of information have been exhausted and employee history is still not complete, it will be necessary to ask the employee to provide additional information (i.e. pay stubs, personnel action forms). If the employee cannot provide documentation but does have a recollection of their former work, the information gained may be useful in researching other records (i.e. timesheets from archives).\n\nAPPLICABLE BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE EDUCATION CODE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE\n\nStudents\n\n\"Student worker\" is defined as a person employed part time by the District who is a full time college student. Full time student status is generally recognized by college institutions to be enrollment in not less than 12 course units each semester or equivalent. For the definition of \"College Student Worker\" (CSW) or \"Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistant\" (CCTA), see page 2 of the Agreement settling San Diego Superior Case No. 00707784.\n\nSubstitutes\n\n\"Substitute\" is defined as a person employed by the District for not more than 194 working days, including holidays, sick leave, vacation and other leaves of absence, and who is employed either:\na. to replace a classified worker who is temporarily absent from duty, or\n\nb. to fill a vacancy in a classified position which the District is engaged in a procedure to hire a permanent worker to fill the vacancy, provided the District does not fill the vacancy with one or more substitutes for more than 60 days.\n\nShort-Term Workers\n\n\"Short-term worker\" has been defined by the San Diego Superior Court as a District employee who is employed and paid for less than 75% of the school year (195 working days, including paid leaves) and who is employed to perform specific services that are not extended or needed on a continuing basis, regardless of his or her trade.\n\nPARTICULAR SITUATIONS\n\nService in Multiple Job Classes as Hourlies\n\nTo determine proper seniority for employees who were misclassified as hourlies in more than one job class, standards will be used to identify which out-of-class assignments will be treated as:\n\n    a. promotions to a higher job class\n    b. legitimate temporary out-of-class work, or\n    c. voluntary demotions to a lower job class\n\nFirst test: Was the employee working daily in the second classification? If work was not regular and continuing, the assignment was considered a legitimate use of temporary out-of-class.\n\nSecond test: If the work was regular and continuing, and in a higher job class, and if the employee did not return to their former classification, the second job class is considered a promotion. (If they returned to their former classification, the\nassignment is legitimate TOC.) If the work was regular and continuing, and in a lower job class the assignment in the second job class is considered a voluntary demotion so long as the employee was not concurrently and regularly employed in a higher class.\n\nTemporary Out-of-Class Assignments\n\nEducation Code 45110 requires districts, as prescribed in that section, to adjust the compensation for classified employees working out-of class. The Education Code does not stipulate the reasons for such employment or the amount of time an employee may be maintained out-of-class. Employees may have been employed out-of-class. No change should be made to any time served in class as a result of TOC appointments, so long as the employee has received full credit for TOC time in his or her classification.\n\nRestricted Status\n\nThe Education Code provides that employees who were hired under Restricted Status for the CETA program or with ESEA funds and subsequently hired as probationary employees would have their original date of hire recognized for seniority purposes. (Education Code 45105 and 45105.1)\n\nWhere restricted status appointments were used improperly, the time served shall be revised to regular classified status.\n\nSeparations\n\nWhen an employee resigns or is terminated by the district, they lose their seniority.\n\nSince hourly and probationary employees were ineligible for leaves of absence, it is necessary to review separations in light of an employee's change of status. For example, if the employee was forced to resign due to health reasons as an hourly, he/she would have been eligible for a leave of absence as a monthly. (See Leave of Absence section below.)\n\nMicrofiche pay records can be used to verify separations determined not to be leaves of absence. In some cases, the\nemployee may be separated from one job class or location but continue to work in another. The microfiche pay records should document that employment was continuous.\n\nLeaves of Absence\n\nThere are several types of LOA's. Long-term leaves for illness or injury are not considered a break in service (Education Code 45192, 45195). For other types of leaves (i.e. professional study), the guidelines are found in the collective negotiations agreements (the collective negotiations agreements limit continued seniority accrual while on leave to health and pregnancy).\n\nFor LOA's where seniority does not continue to accrue, the lost days of service are totaled and \"subtracted\" from the employee's revised classification seniority dates. Calendars for each of these adjustments should be kept so that the adjusted date can easily be reviewed in the future.\n\nTransfer Between Classified and Certificated Job Classes\n\nIf an employee of a school district employed in a position in the classified service is assigned to a position in the same district requiring certification qualifications, the employee shall retain all sick leave, vacation, and other rights and benefits accumulated by the employee at the time he or she is assigned to a position requiring certification qualifications. All seniority and permanency rights shall be secured to the employee during the period of time he or she occupies a position in the certificated service. The employee's return to the classified service at any time shall be treated as if there had not been an interruption in his or her classified service. (Education Code 44064)\n\nVoluntary Demotion\n\nWhen an employee accepts a voluntary demotion, he/she continues to accrue district seniority. If the employee is later reemployed in the higher classification, the time served in the lower class does not count towards seniority in the higher class.\n\nDemotion in Lieu of Lay-Off\nIf an employee accepts a demotion in lieu of lay-off, he/she retains but does not continue to accrue classification seniority in the previous (higher) classification.\n\nReclassifications\n\nWhere seniority involves work that was subsequently reclassified, the new classification is assigned as of the effective date stipulated by Wage and Compensation at the time the study was done, unless the parties agree on a different date, consistent with the Education Code.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PROCESS FOR REVIEW BY EMPLOYEE\n\nAfter research is completed for the classified employees in a department/site, the following actions shall be jointly undertaken by the District and CSEA:\n\n1. Send each employee (including those whose dates will not change) a summary of their employment history with the recommended revisions. A period of ten (10) days will be allowed for review by the employee. After reviewing the recommendations, if the employee agrees with the conclusions, the employee will be asked to sign a form indicating their agreement. Upon their signature, a change in their seniority dates will be authorized. If they do not agree with the information provided, their response needs to include the dates and classifications with which they disagree as well as their assessment of the correct dates and classifications. If the employee fails to return their form within the ten (10) days allowed, the revision will automatically be accepted.\n\n2. A follow-up process will review all contested employment histories.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2026-02-16", "created": "2026-02-16", "metadata": {"Source-File": "dol_archive/document_2809.pdf",
