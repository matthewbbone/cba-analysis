Article 3. Union Rights
Section 2 (continued)

D. The principal or department head, or, in their absence, their designee, shall be notified immediately upon arrival of the union representative and prior to the conduct of union business. Union representatives shall comply with all site/department procedures required of visitors.

E. Visits to unit members, at their work site, for the purpose of investigating and processing grievances, may be made during work hours by prearrangement with the principal, department head, or designee. The principal, department head, or designee shall provide a private area for such grievance processing.

F. Loss of time due to investigation of or attendance at grievance conferences between the union representatives and the unit member(s) shall be limited to reasonable time periods mutually agreed upon between the supervisor and the union representative. Conference(s) should be scheduled at times that will least affect the efficient operation of the unit member’s school or department.

G. Visits shall be conducted in appropriate rooms, areas, or work locations not impinging upon the work of other employees. The location shall be determined by mutual agreement between the designated union representative and principal, department head, or designee. The District shall make every reasonable effort to provide a convenient, appropriate location suitable for the purpose of the union representative’s business.

H. Union representatives shall complete any forms provided by the District for the purposes of assisting in filing a mandated costs reimbursement claim with the State of California.

Section 3: BULLETIN BOARDS

The District shall provide institutional bulletin boards in areas which are mutually agreeable to the Union and the District and which are reasonably accessible to unit members. Bulletin boards will be located in areas which are not normally used by students and public, but where unit members congregate, and shall not be used for non-Union-sponsored commercial advertising purposes. Posting shall be done by authorized union representatives only.

Section 4: USE OF TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL DURING NON-WORK HOURS

1. The District agrees to provide unit members reasonable use of telephones during non-work hours. In emergency situations requiring immediate attention, such time limitations may be waived.

2. The Parties agree that the union representatives and the unit members shall have the right to reasonable use of the District’s e-mail system for the purpose of communicating with respect to matters of District-Union business and not for purposes of communicating with respect to matters that are only union business.
