ARTICLE 16. ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY

Section 6: PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD (PERB) REGULATIONS

The Parties recognize that PERB may, from time to time, adopt procedures regulating fair share (agency fees). It is the intent of the Parties that the Union abide by such regulations in the collection of such fair share fees. The Parties further agree that any action to enforce such regulations shall be brought solely by unit member(s) who claim violation of the regulations, and that such actions (if any) shall not interfere with rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Upon request of the unit member, the Union shall provide a copy of the most current set of PERB regulations regarding this subject.

Section 7: HOLD HARMLESS

The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless the District, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims, losses, and expenses occurring or resulting from the enforcement or challenge to the legality of the provisions of this Article. This hold harmless provision is intended to apply to circumstances involving a third-party challenge to the legality of the provisions of this Article and not to grievances or other disputes between the District and the Union involving the interpretation or implementation of these provisions.

The Union shall have the authority and right to decide and defend any such action. It shall have the right to determine whether any such litigation shall or shall not be compromised, defended, resisted, tried or appealed. Prior to the exercise of these rights, the Union shall be required to inform and consult with the District.

Section 8: MISCELLANEOUS
