position showing its work location.

12. Two percentages shall be used to assist in monitoring compliance with paragraph 11. "The Unit percentage" is 55% or the District-wide number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) paraeducator-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total of FTE paraeducator-filled positions and FTE CSW-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher. A FTE paraeducator-filled position is 8 hours per day. A FTE CSW-filled position is 6 hours per day. "The benefited percentage" is 55% or the District-wide number of paraeducators who are incumbents of positions assigned 4 hours or more per day as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total number of paraeducators as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher.

13. Upon request, the District shall furnish CSEA with all information relevant to whether the District has met the provisions of paragraph 11, above. For monitoring purposes, the Unit percentage and the benefited percentage, although calculated from District-wide figures, shall be applied to each work location. If in the future either percentage, when calculated from FTE positions or paraeducators at a particular work location, falls below the levels specified in paragraph 13, the parties shall meet upon the request of CSEA to determine the reasons for one or both of the percentages being below the specified levels. The District shall have the burden of demonstrating that, notwithstanding the lower percentage(s), it is in compliance with paragraph 11, above.

14. Classified workers in the Unit who have a classification seniority date changed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall be paid for all wages, benefits and other emoluments of employment lost after December 19, 1995 as a result of their improper exclusion from the District's classified service.

15. The parties agree to meet promptly and attempt to resolve any disputes arising under the Agreement. Nothing will prevent the parties from agreeing upon methods of resolving such disputes short of going to court.
