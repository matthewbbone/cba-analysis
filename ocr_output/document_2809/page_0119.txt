SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO

CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, CHAPTER NO. 759,
Petitioner,

v.

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT,
Respondent.

CASE NO. 00707784

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

Judge: Judith McConnell
Department 51

This settlement agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between the San Diego Unified School District (the District) in order to avoid the expense and risk of further litigation.

The District confirms that, effective with the spring term of the 1997-98 school year, it will discontinue the designation of employees as Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistants (CCTA's) and will require all existing CCTA's to work within and meet the qualifications for Classroom College Student Workers (CSW's). This does not restrict the District's right to employ workers outside its classified service, provided they fall within a statutory exemption from the classification requirement. Each party acknowledges that the execution of the Agreement does not constitute admission of, or concession to, any argument, premise or position of the other party.
