Section 14: PROMOTION

A. Promotion From Another Classified Salary Schedule: A unit member who is promoted from a position on another classified unit members' salary schedule to a position on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule with a higher maximum salary will first have his/her salary determined in the appropriate grade of the other classified salary schedule in accordance with existing regulations and then will be paid at the rate in the appropriate salary grade on either salary schedule which would provide an approximate five percent (5%) increase (exclusive of special pay additives) but not more than seven and one-half percent (7.5%) increase. In no case shall the salary step placement exceed the maximum for the appropriate salary grade. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.

B. Promotion Within Paraeducator Salary Schedule. A unit member who is promoted from one job class on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule to a higher job class will be placed on the step of the higher salary grade which is at least one full salary grade or approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half [7.5%]) in amount above the unit member's salary exclusive of special pay additives at the time of promotion. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.

C. Next Service Increment. If a service increment is not immediately due at the time of promotion to a higher job class, it will be granted in the higher job class on the same date it would have been granted in the lower job class. If a service increment is not due at the time of promotion to a higher job class because the unit member has already reached the maximum step on the salary grade of the lower job class, a new service increment due date will be effective on the anniversary date (first day of the month in the month promoted for unit members promoted between the first [1st] and fifteenth [15th] of the month; first [1st] day of the month following the month promoted for unit members promoted on or after the sixteenth [16th] of the month), and additional service increments due will be granted beginning one (1) year thereafter until the maximum salary for the job class is reached.

D. A unit member who voluntarily accepts a demotion and who is promoted to the former higher job class within thirty-six (36) months will be placed on the step of the appropriate salary grade that was held prior to such demotion.

E. Temporary Out-Of Class Assignments. A unit member temporarily assigned to perform higher level duties not reasonably consistent with those prescribed for the regular job class for more than four (4) workdays within a fifteen (15) calendar-day period will receive an upward salary adjustment. The salary adjustment will be effective for the entire period of such temporary assignment. The amount of the adjustment will be the same as would be provided by the regular promotional rules as determined by Director, Classified Personnel.
