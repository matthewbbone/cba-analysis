ARTICLE 7. WAGES
Section 7 (continued)

G. Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Differential. The Union and the District acknowledge the additional skills and services provided by Educational Interpreters who possess certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), and therefore agree to establish an RID differential. This differential will be paid with funds previously used for compensating substitute/hourly interpreters. A RID-certified unit member classified as Educational Interpreter II or Educational Interpreter III will receive a pay differential if assigned duties which require certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. Duties which require such certification are those where interpreting services involve officials from law enforcement and/or Child Protective Services. The unit member’s immediate supervisor must authorize the performance of such duties. The differential will be paid in increments of one (1) hour for each full or partial hour worked requiring RID certification. Such differential will amount to placement on the next higher salary grade which is approximately ten percent (10%) above the unit member's regular salary.

Section 8: INITIAL PLACEMENT ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE

A. Position Class. A unit member will be placed in the job class appropriate to the assigned position.

B. Experience Step. A unit member new to the District will be placed on Step "A" of the appropriate salary grade. The Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, may authorize a higher step placement within the appropriate grade for an especially well-qualified individual in a job class for which qualified candidates are found to be in short supply. In such instances, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, will provide written notification to the Union.

Section 9: SERVICE INCREMENTS

A. Assignment of Four (4) or More Hours Per Day. A unit member in a regular monthly assignment of four (4) hours or more per day will be granted a one (1) step salary increase on his/her annual anniversary date as established in accordance with the collective negotiations contract until the “E.5” Step is reached.

B. Assignment of Less Than Four (4) Hours Per Day. A unit member in a regular monthly assignment of less than four (4) hours per day will be placed on the "A" Step of the appropriate salary grade and will be granted a one-half (1/2) step salary increase (approximately two and one-half percent [2.5%]) on the anniversary date of his/her employment/promotion until the “D.5” Step is reached. Advancement beyond the "D.5" Step is limited to unit members in regular monthly assignments of four (4) or more hours per day. The anniversary date will be established in the same manner as defined in the collective negotiations contract.
