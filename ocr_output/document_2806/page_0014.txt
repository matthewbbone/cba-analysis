56. Only persons authorized by the Commanding Officer of the Personnel Division may review an employee’s master personnel file.

57. This section regarding employee access and authorized review applies to materials contained in files of cases classified as improper conduct in the Management Control Division and EEO Unit after the Chief determines to proceed with disciplinary action. All other access to the files at the Management Control Division and EEO Unit must be pursuant to a valid discovery motion filed and approved by the Police Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction except as provided in subsection D. below regarding sealed reprimands except where access is deemed by the City to pertain to investigations, EEO compliance, Consent Decrees or other legal or administrative proceedings.
