C. Agency Shop.

35. 1. Application. The provisions of this section shall apply to all police officers of bargaining unit P-1.

36. 2. Implementation. An agency shop shall be implemented within representation units or subunits when:

a. Election

37. The Union has requested, in writing, an election on the issue, to be conducted by the State Conciliation Service and 50% plus one of those voting favor implementation of an agency shop, or

b. 2/3 Membership

38. The Union makes a showing that 2/3 of the employees within the unit or subunit are dues-paying members of the Union, or

c. New Employees

39. The Union requests, in writing, an agency shop be implemented for all employees hired after a date to be agreed to by the Union and the Employee Relations Division.

40. 3. Service Fee. All police officers of bargaining unit P-1 except as set forth below, shall, as a condition of continued employment, become and remain a member of the Association, or in lieu thereof, shall pay a service fee to the Association. The fair share service fee payment shall be established annually by the Association, provided that such fair share agency shop service fee will be used by the Association only for the purposes permitted by law. The Association shall give all non-member employees of affected bargaining units written notice of their obligation to either join or pay an agency shop fee as a condition of employment. After such notice and a time period agreed to by the parties, service fees from non-members shall be collected by payroll deduction pursuant to Administrative Code Section 16.90. Failure to comply with this section shall be grounds for termination. The Association, at its option, may elect to waive its rights to demand termination and instead utilize judicial process to compel payment.

41. 4. Financial Reporting. Annually, the Association will provide an explanation of the fee and sufficient financial information to enable the fair share service fee payer to gauge the appropriateness of the fee. The Association will provide a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker, not chosen by the Association, and will make provision for an escrow account to hold amounts reasonably in dispute while challenges are pending.
