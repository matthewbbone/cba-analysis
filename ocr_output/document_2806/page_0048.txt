C. RULES GOVERNING TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS

1. Temporary modified duty assignments are those assignments within the Department that can be performed by members who temporarily cannot perform the essential functions of their position.

2. Temporary modified duty assignments available to members will be subject to the following limitations:

a. Members will not be placed at district stations unless otherwise authorized by the Deputy Chief of Administration, and approved by the Chief of Police. These assignments shall be reviewed every 30 days.

b. Members in temporary modified duty assignments shall be eligible for premium pay such as like work-like pay and overtime assignments, including but not limited to PLES overtime, as long as such assignments are consistent with the member's medical restrictions and the needs of the Department. Disputes about this issue will be submitted to the Deputy Chief of Administration for determination.

c. Any involuntary transfer or reassignment shall require 48 hours notice, absent an emergency.

3. No sworn member shall be given a temporary modified duty assignment in a budgeted non-sworn position.

D. PROCESS FOR RECEIVING A TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENT

1. The process for receiving a temporary modified duty assignment begins either when the Department receives: (1) notification from Workers' Compensation Division that a member with an industrial injury may return to work in a modified duty capacity; or (2) a memorandum from a member with a non-industrial injury requesting to return to work in a temporary modified-duty capacity.

2. The member's medical work restrictions are reviewed at the Staff Services Division, which shall compare the limitation(s) placed on the member by his or her treating physician with available temporary modified duty assignments. The Department may review the limitation(s) placed on the member by his or her treating physician with the City's independent medical expert and/or the Department Physician.
