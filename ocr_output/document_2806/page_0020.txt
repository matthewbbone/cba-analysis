G. Solo Motorcycle Officers.

103. The following shall apply to Solo Motorcycle Officers in the ranks of “Police Officer.”

104. 1. There shall be one Department-wide transfer list for Co. K Solos and the Airport Bureau Solos.

105. 2. For purpose of the bi-annual seniority sign-up, Solo Motorcycle Officers in Co. K and at the Airport Bureau will be treated as one unit.

106. 3. The Airport Bureau Solo Motorcycle Officers shall have a unit seniority date of January 1, 2001 for the purposes, only, of the bi-annual seniority sign-up. These Officers shall have this unit seniority date for watch-sign purposes so long as they remain at the Airport Bureau.

107. 4. In the event two Solo Motorcycle Officers from either Co. K or the Airport Bureau share the same unit seniority date, their departmental seniority date will be the tiebreaker for seniority sign-up purposes.

108. 5. During each bi-annual seniority sign-up, Co. K will post its bid positions; then Airport Bureau will post its bid positions. Solo Motorcycle Officers, from either unit, may then sign-up for open positions in either unit on the basis of their unit seniority.

109. 6. No employee of the Co. K Solo Motorcycle Unit or the Airport Bureau Solo Motorcycle Unit assigned to such unit prior to January 1, 2001, will be displaced from their unit as a result of the bi-annual seniority sign-up.

111. 8. Any future Solo Motorcycle Officer vacancies in either Co. K or the Airport Bureau will be offered to the next officer on the P-1 list. Any officer filling a vacancy from the P-1 list shall remain in that assignment until the next bi-annual seniority sign-up. At that time any such officer may exercise his or her unit seniority to fill any vacancy in either unit.
