Section 5. Grievance Procedure.

15. The City and the Association recognize that early settlement of grievances is essential to sound employee-employer relations. The parties seek to establish a mutually satisfactory method for the settlement of grievances, as provided for below. In presenting a grievance, the aggrieved and/or his or her representative is assured freedom from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination or reprisal.

16. Grievances or disputes regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement or relating to working conditions arising out of this Agreement, or relating to General Orders 3.08, 3.15, 11.01, 11.03, 11.05, 11.06 and 11.10, including the arbitrability thereof, shall be settled in conformity with the following procedure. Except, however, actions taken by the City that are necessary to ensure compliance with federal, state or local laws, ordinances or regulations, or that are mandated by the terms of a consent decree, shall not be grievable hereunder. After notice of such intended action by the City, the Association may however, offer in writing its view on compliance and possible alternative solutions, within ten (10) days to the Chief of Police who shall respond in writing to the Association within ten (10) business days. In addition, in the event the City acts on a matter it has reasonably determined to be mandated by or necessary to ensure compliance with a consent decree or with federal, state, or local laws, ordinances or regulations, that action shall not be grievable hereunder. In the event a grievance is filed relating to such actions, arbitrability shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The supervisor shall attempt to adjust the grievance at the time and render a written decision within seven (7) calendar days.

Step II

18. If the grievance is not resolved in Step I, the grievant or the Association representative shall submit the grievance in writing to the commanding officer. The grievance must be filed with the commanding officer not later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the decision by the employee from the immediate supervisor, stating the reasons why the Step I answer was not satisfactory.

19. After review and discussion, the commanding officer shall notify the grievant(s) and the Association representative within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance, in writing, of the decision and the reasons.
