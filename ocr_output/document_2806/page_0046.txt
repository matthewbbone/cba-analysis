B. DURATION OF TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS

1. Limited To 365 Days. Temporary modified duty assignments shall be limited in duration to a maximum of 365 days. At the end of 30 days of a temporary modified duty assignment, or earlier if warranted, a member shall be reviewed by the Staff Services Division to determine whether the member will be able to return to his or her regular assignment. If the modified assignment extends beyond 30 days, the member's status will be reviewed every 30 days up to the maximum 365-day duration. Approximately 90 days prior to the expiration of the 365 day temporary modified duty assignment, the Department will notify members of the options set forth in subsection 3. below. Prior to the expiration of the 365 day temporary modified duty assignment, the Department will consider and discuss with those members the options set forth in subsection 3. below.

2. Available Only If Members May Return To Regular Position. If before or during the temporary modified duty assignment the Department's Physician determines that the member will not be able to return to his or her regular position prior to the expiration of the temporary modified duty assignment, then the Department will consider and discuss with the member the options set forth in subsection 3. below. At this point, the member will no longer be eligible for temporary modified duty. In making this determination, the Department's Physician may consult with the City's independent medical expert, medically examine the member, review medical records, and/or consult with the member's treating physician.

3. End Of Temporary Modified Duty Assignment. Once a member is permanent and stationary and/or has served in a temporary modified duty position for 365 days, or earlier if warranted, the Department will consider and discuss with the member the following options: (1) returning the member to full duty; (2) granting a request for a disability accommodation under the ADA and/or state law (which may include a disability transfer under the City's disability transfer policy); (3) recommending disability retirement; (4) providing an unpaid leave of absence pursuant to the Civil Service Rules; (5) allowing sick leave or FMLA leave; or (6) initiating non-punitive medical separation if none of the above are appropriate.
