ARTICLE II. EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS

Section 1.    Non-Discrimination.

48. The City and the Association agree that no person employed or applying for employment shall in any way be discriminated against because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, physical handicap, age, political affiliation or opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation, nor shall such a person be the subject of sexual or racial harassment. This paragraph shall not be construed to restrict or proscribe voluntary affirmative action efforts by the Department; nor shall any rule, policy, procedure, order, action, determination or practice taken to ensure compliance with the purpose, goals, or requirements of a consent decree be restricted by the provisions of this paragraph.

49. This section is not intended to affect the right of an employee to elect any applicable administrative remedy for discrimination proscribed herein.

52. An employee who elects an administrative remedy other than the grievance procedure contained in this MOU for discrimination proscribed herein, and whose complaint is not resolved within thirty (30) days, shall have the right to seek relief in accord with the grievance procedure. In such instances, the employee may initiate his/her grievance at Step III.

53. It is understood and agreed that any disciplinary action against an employee that may be initiated or result from the application or interpretation of these provisions shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article I, Section 5 of this Agreement. Any action grieved pursuant to this section and determined to be violative thereof may be set aside by the Chief of the Department or the Police Commission.
