compensatory time at the rate of time-and-one-half at the employee's option pursuant to Article III., Section 2 of this Agreement.

172. C. Employees working a work week other than Monday through Friday shall be allowed another day off if a holiday falls on one of their regularly scheduled days off. Employees whose holidays are changed because of shift rotations shall be allowed another day off if a legal holiday falls on one of their days off.

173. D. If the provisions of this section deprive any employee of the same number of holidays that an employee receives who works Monday through Friday, he/she shall be granted additional days off to equal such number of holidays. The designation of such days off shall be by mutual agreement of the employee and the appropriate supervisor with the approval of the appointing officer. In no event shall the provisions of this section result in such employee receiving more or less holidays than an employee on a Monday through Friday work schedule.

174. E. This section shall not modify existing holiday compensation practice.

Section 4. Special Pays.

Special pay shall be provided to employees as follows:

A. Canine Duty

175. Employees assigned to canine duty shall receive additional compensation bi-weekly equal to 5% of base wage as compensation for off duty time authorized and expended in the care and maintenance of the assigned canine, including feeding, grooming, exercising and cleaning up after the canine. This amount has been calculated by the parties to represent approximately eight hours of overtime per week paid at one and one-half times the hourly rate of the federal minimum wage. This extra compensation is not to be considered base pay or premium pay, nor shall it be included for purposes of retirement benefit calculations or contributions.

176. In addition to the above referenced overtime compensation for the ordinary and extraordinary care of the canine and, as authorized by the Department, the City will provide for basic canine food and supplies and shall provide for all appropriate veterinary care through approved City vendors. The City will reimburse other expenses reasonably and customarily incurred in the maintenance and care of the dog. Employees assigned to the Airport Bureau who perform canine duties shall be provided with vehicles for transportation of canines from their home to work and back.
