3. It is the mutual understanding of the City and the Association that the compensation attached to those ranks for which a POST certificate is required is not an increase in the general rate of remuneration for the ranks or position of Q-2, Q-35, Q-50 and 0380, Q-60 and 0460, Q-80, 0488 and/or 0400 within the meaning of the Charter of the City and County, including but not limited to Section A8.559-6.

4. Should any retiree or other party initiate litigation challenging this mutual interpretation, and the mutual intent of these parties, and seek to obtain an adjustment of allowances for any Police Department retirees pursuant to the Charter of the City and County based upon this Agreement, the SFPPOA shall fully support the defense of such claims by the City and County, and shall take appropriate legal steps to intervene in, and become party to, such litigation and in such litigation will fully support the mutual intention of the parties as described in this Agreement.

5. The parties and each and every individual employee specifically agree and recognize that this Agreement creates no vested rights. Should any final judgment by superior court or court of competent jurisdiction at any time adjudge and decree that retirees are entitled to an adjustment of their allowances as a result of the establishment of these ranks, then the Agreement which created these ranks and set a new base rate for such ranks to be included within the rate of remuneration for pension calculation purposes shall be null and void, and shall cease immediately. If such a judgment issues, the parties further hereby agree that the base pay rate and premium of each appointee to these ranks shall retroactively revert to the then current base rate of pay and to the premium eligibility provided by the Memorandum of Understanding prior to the creation of these ranks. The parties also agree to retroactively recalculate the retirement contribution and allowance of such officers as if this agreement had never been in effect. Provided, however, that if such a recalculation should occur, no bargaining unit employee who had received compensation based on the rates of pay for these ranks shall be obligated to pay back any monies which they had received between the effective date of their appointment and the time of such recalculation. Thereafter, the City and the Association shall mutually engage in meeting and conferring in order to reach agreement on alternative benefits.

Section 2.    No Work Stoppages.

6. During the time this MOU is in force and effect, the Association and each member of its bargaining unit covenant and agree that she/he/it will not authorize, engage or participate in any strike, work slowdown or any form of work stoppage including but not limited to absenteeism, observing picket lines or any other form of sympathy strike.

Section 3.    Management Authorities.

7. The City shall have authority for the policies and administration of the Department and the power to organize, reorganize and manage the Police Department and its employees. Nothing in this document shall be interpreted as abrogating the Charter in any of its parts. Said authority shall
