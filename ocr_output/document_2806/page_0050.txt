DGO 11.12
Rev. 01/07/04

B. The Committee shall convene within 30 days of the receipt of the ADA coordinator's recommendation or sooner at the request of the member. At the meeting, the member requesting accommodation is entitled to be present and be represented by the Police Officers' Association or any other representative chosen by the member. The Committee shall consider the following:

1. The nature, extent and seriousness of the member's restrictions, i.e., whether the member has restrictions that limit one or more major life activities.

2. Whether the member, with reasonable accommodation, could perform the essential functions of his or her full-duty position, including through such methods as restructuring nonessential functions, or other means which do not pose an undue hardship to the Department or pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the members and others.

3. When the Committee determines that a member cannot be reasonably accommodated to perform the essential job functions of his or her sworn position, the ADA coordinator shall refer the member to the Department of Human Resources for a 60 day concurrent Department; and City-wide search for job vacancies which meet the member's medical restrictions and for which the member meets the minimum qualifications. The member may elect not to participate in the Citywide search by notifying the Department of this election in writing.

4. In addition, when the Committee determines that a member cannot be reasonably accommodated to perform the essential job functions of his or her sworn position, the Committee will consider and discuss with the member one of the following options: (1) recommending disability retirement; (2) providing an unpaid leave of absence pursuant to the Civil Service Rules; (3) allowing sick leave or FMLA leave; or (4) initiating non-punitive medical separation if none of the above are appropriate, and the member has not been placed in another position pursuant to the 60 day concurrent Department; and City-wide search for job vacancies.

5. In determining whether to recommend a member for ordinary or industrial disability retirement, the Committee shall consider any or all of the following: Workers Compensation Appeals Board determination(s), Disability Evaluation Unit rating(s), nature and extent of medical restrictions or limitations, body part(s) affected, length of service, and relevant medical reports.

6. The Duty Evaluation Committee will consider the factors above, and will not consider a member's refusal to participate in the Citywide search or to accept an offered non-sworn position.

7. Based on all of the above, the Duty Evaluation Committee shall make a determination and shall communicate that to the member in a timely fashion.
