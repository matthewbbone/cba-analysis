Therefore, the parties agree that such terms will read as if they accurately referenced the same sections in their newly codified form as of July 1, 2003.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThis Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter \"MOU\") constitutes a mutual agreement between the San Francisco Police Officers' Association (hereinafter referred to as the \"Association\") and the City and County of San Francisco (hereinafter referred to as the \"City\"), through the Office of the Mayor acting on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Police Commission and the Chief of Police, arrived at through good faith meeting and conferring pursuant to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act and Charter Section A8.590-1, et. seq.\nARTICLE I. REPRESENTATION\n\nSection 1. Recognition.\n\n1. Pursuant to Government Code Section 3500, et. seq., the City recognizes the Association as the majority bargaining agent for sworn personnel of the San Francisco Police Department in the following bargaining units and classifications:\n\nP-1 Police Rank and File\n    Q-2   Police Officer\n    Q-3   Police Officer II\n    Q-4   Police Officer III\n    Q-35  Assistant Inspector\n    Q-36  Assistant Inspector II\n    Q-37  Assistant Inspector III\n    Q-50  Sergeant\n    Q-51  Sergeant II\n    Q-52  Sergeant III\n    0380  Inspector\n    0381  Inspector II\n    0382  Inspector III\n    9350  Harbor Police Officer\n\nP-2A Police Supervisory\n    Q-60  Lieutenant\n    Q-61  Lieutenant II\n    Q-62  Lieutenant III\n    Q-80  Captain\n    Q-81  Captain II\n    Q-82  Captain III\n\nP-2B Police Management Supervisory\n    0400  Deputy Chief\n    0401  Deputy Chief II\n    0402  Deputy Chief III\n    0488  Commander\n    0489  Commander II\n    0490  Commander III\n\n2. Active officers who obtain sufficient education and experience to meet the minimum qualifications of the ranks containing a POST certificate requirement shall be appointed to such ranks within thirty (30) days after they present to the appointing officer evidence that they possess the POST certification required for the rank.\n3. It is the mutual understanding of the City and the Association that the compensation attached to those ranks for which a POST certificate is required is not an increase in the general rate of remuneration for the ranks or position of Q-2, Q-35, Q-50 and 0380, Q-60 and 0460, Q-80, 0488 and/or 0400 within the meaning of the Charter of the City and County, including but not limited to Section A8.559-6.\n\n4. Should any retiree or other party initiate litigation challenging this mutual interpretation, and the mutual intent of these parties, and seek to obtain an adjustment of allowances for any Police Department retirees pursuant to the Charter of the City and County based upon this Agreement, the SFPPOA shall fully support the defense of such claims by the City and County, and shall take appropriate legal steps to intervene in, and become party to, such litigation and in such litigation will fully support the mutual intention of the parties as described in this Agreement.\n\n5. The parties and each and every individual employee specifically agree and recognize that this Agreement creates no vested rights. Should any final judgment by superior court or court of competent jurisdiction at any time adjudge and decree that retirees are entitled to an adjustment of their allowances as a result of the establishment of these ranks, then the Agreement which created these ranks and set a new base rate for such ranks to be included within the rate of remuneration for pension calculation purposes shall be null and void, and shall cease immediately. If such a judgment issues, the parties further hereby agree that the base pay rate and premium of each appointee to these ranks shall retroactively revert to the then current base rate of pay and to the premium eligibility provided by the Memorandum of Understanding prior to the creation of these ranks. The parties also agree to retroactively recalculate the retirement contribution and allowance of such officers as if this agreement had never been in effect. Provided, however, that if such a recalculation should occur, no bargaining unit employee who had received compensation based on the rates of pay for these ranks shall be obligated to pay back any monies which they had received between the effective date of their appointment and the time of such recalculation. Thereafter, the City and the Association shall mutually engage in meeting and conferring in order to reach agreement on alternative benefits.\n\nSection 2.    No Work Stoppages.\n\n6. During the time this MOU is in force and effect, the Association and each member of its bargaining unit covenant and agree that she/he/it will not authorize, engage or participate in any strike, work slowdown or any form of work stoppage including but not limited to absenteeism, observing picket lines or any other form of sympathy strike.\n\nSection 3.    Management Authorities.\n\n7. The City shall have authority for the policies and administration of the Department and the power to organize, reorganize and manage the Police Department and its employees. Nothing in this document shall be interpreted as abrogating the Charter in any of its parts. Said authority shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, work rules and regulations. This paragraph is not to be interpreted as a limitation on the rights of the Association under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.\n\nSection 4. Negotiation Responsibility.\n\n8. A. Except in cases of emergency, the City/Department shall give reasonable written notice to the Association of any proposed change in general orders or other matters within the scope of representation as specified in Government Code Section 3504.5. The Association shall be provided with the opportunity to meet and confer with regard to any such proposed change should it desire to do so.\n\n9. In cases of emergency when the City/Department determines that a proposed change as described herein must be adopted immediately without prior notice or meetings with the Association, the City/Department shall provide such notice and opportunity to meet at the earliest practicable time following the adoption of such change.\n\n10. B. If the Association does not respond within ten (10) working days from the date of receipt of written notification of a proposed change as described in subsection A. hereof, the Association shall be deemed to have waived its opportunity to meet and confer on the proposed change.\n\n11. C. If the Association timely requests the opportunity to meet and confer as provided herein, the City/Department, with the direct assistance and participation of the Employee Relations Division, agrees to meet and confer with the Association over such proposed change or changes, within ten (10) days of such timely request, unless a longer period of time is mutually agreed upon, in order to freely exchange information, opinions and proposals and to endeavor to reach agreement on the proposed change or changes.\n\n12. D. If no agreement is reached, the matter shall, at the request of either party, be resolved pursuant to the impasse procedures set forth in Charter Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7. Staffing matters, except for current safety practices pertaining to two-officer vehicles, shall be excluded from the impasse procedures set forth in Charter Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7.\n\n13. E. Except as provided in subsection C. hereof, the Association agrees that it will make no proposals for change in the terms and conditions of employment of bargaining unit members for the duration of this Memorandum.\n\n14. F. This Memorandum sets forth the full and entire understanding of the parties regarding the matters set forth herein, and any and all prior and existing Memoranda of Understanding, Understandings, or Agreements, whether formal or informal, are hereby superseded or terminated in their entirety. This Memorandum may be modified, but only in writing, upon the mutual consent of the parties and ratification by the Board of Supervisors.\nSection 5. Grievance Procedure.\n\n15. The City and the Association recognize that early settlement of grievances is essential to sound employee-employer relations. The parties seek to establish a mutually satisfactory method for the settlement of grievances, as provided for below. In presenting a grievance, the aggrieved and/or his or her representative is assured freedom from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination or reprisal.\n\n16. Grievances or disputes regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement or relating to working conditions arising out of this Agreement, or relating to General Orders 3.08, 3.15, 11.01, 11.03, 11.05, 11.06 and 11.10, including the arbitrability thereof, shall be settled in conformity with the following procedure. Except, however, actions taken by the City that are necessary to ensure compliance with federal, state or local laws, ordinances or regulations, or that are mandated by the terms of a consent decree, shall not be grievable hereunder. After notice of such intended action by the City, the Association may however, offer in writing its view on compliance and possible alternative solutions, within ten (10) days to the Chief of Police who shall respond in writing to the Association within ten (10) business days. In addition, in the event the City acts on a matter it has reasonably determined to be mandated by or necessary to ensure compliance with a consent decree or with federal, state, or local laws, ordinances or regulations, that action shall not be grievable hereunder. In the event a grievance is filed relating to such actions, arbitrability shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nStep I\n\n17. Where an employee initiates the grievance, the employee shall submit the grievance in writing to the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor within thirty (30) days of the facts or event giving rise to the grievance. The supervisor shall attempt to adjust the grievance at the time and render a written decision within seven (7) calendar days.\n\nStep II\n\n18. If the grievance is not resolved in Step I, the grievant or the Association representative shall submit the grievance in writing to the commanding officer. The grievance must be filed with the commanding officer not later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the decision by the employee from the immediate supervisor, stating the reasons why the Step I answer was not satisfactory.\n\n19. After review and discussion, the commanding officer shall notify the grievant(s) and the Association representative within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance, in writing, of the decision and the reasons.\n\nStep III\n\n20. If the grievance is not resolved in Step II, the Association representative shall submit the\ngrievance to the Chief of Police within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the commanding officer's decision stating the reasons why the Step II answer is not satisfactory.\n\n21. The Chief will review the material submitted and shall hold a meeting on the grievance at the request of the Association representative on behalf of the grievant, unless the Chief is not empowered to act. The Chief shall respond in writing to the grievant, and the Association, within ten (10) working days.\n\nStep IV\n\n22. If the grievance is not resolved at Step III, the Association has the right to appeal the decision of the Chief of Police to arbitration. Prior to doing so and within seven (7) calendar days, the Association shall notify the Chief of Police and the Director, Employee Relations Division or his/her designee of the Association\u2019s decision to so appeal, and shall forward the relevant materials to the Director, Employee Relations. The Director, Employee Relations shall have twelve (12) calendar days after receipt of the written grievance to review and seek resolution of the grievance.\n\n23. If the Director, Employee Relations is unable to resolve the grievance to the mutual satisfaction of the parties in the time prescribed, the grievance may then be submitted only by the Association to arbitration.\n\n24. The arbitrator shall be an impartial person selected by mutual consent of the parties. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days from the date of receipt of the Employee Relations Division\u2019s response, the parties shall select an arbitrator from a list of seven (7) names from the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service.\n\n25. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The Arbitrator shall not have the right to alter, amend, delete or add to any of the terms of this Agreement.\n\n26. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this MOU, disciplinary or punitive actions described in Charter Section 8.343 cannot be grieved or arbitrated. An arbitrator selected pursuant hereto shall have no authority to hear or decide any such disciplinary or punitive actions.\n\n27. An Arbitrator selected pursuant to this Agreement shall have no power or authority to alter or supersede the Charter, the Civil Service Commission rules, the Administrative Code or the Federal Consent Decree.\n\n28. The parties shall share the jointly-incurred costs of the arbitration proceedings. Each party shall in good faith divulge to the other party all available material facts at the time said party acquires knowledge thereof concerning the matter in dispute.\n\n29. Nothing herein shall restrict the right of the City or the Department to initiate grievances under this Agreement. In such instance, only Steps III and IV shall be applicable prior to the determination to proceed to arbitration.\nSection 6. Release Time for POA Representatives.\n\n30. An employee may designate another employee below the rank of Commander to represent him/her in grievance or discipline meetings mutually scheduled with Department management and scheduled appeals hearings without loss of pay or benefits to the extent such representation occurs on regular scheduled time, and provided such use of on-duty time is reasonable.\n\n31. A reasonable number of Association representatives may participate with management in mutually scheduled employer-employee relations meetings on their regularly scheduled duty time without loss of pay or benefits.\n\nSection 7. Association.\n\nA. Payroll Deductions.\n\n32. The Association shall provide the Employee Relations Director and the City Controller with a complete list of the City classifications subject to this section represented by the Association, a statement of the membership dues for employees in each classification, and a list of employees in said classification who have signed authorizations for payroll dues deductions. Such list of represented classifications and statement of membership dues shall be amended as necessary. The Controller may take up to thirty (30) days to implement such changes. The Controller shall make required membership dues payroll deductions for the Association as designated from the list submitted by the Association. The Association shall pay the reasonable costs of this service. Such costs shall be established by the Controller of the City and County of San Francisco.\n\n33. Effective the first complete pay period commencing after the receipt of dues authorization deduction forms by the Controller and each pay period thereafter, the Controller shall make membership dues deductions, as appropriate, from the regular periodic payroll warrant of each POA member described above.\n\nB. Maintenance of Membership.\n\n34. Employees covered by this MOU who have voluntarily joined the Association, and have authorized payroll deduction of dues, initiation fees, premiums for insurance programs and political action fund contributions, shall, for the administrative convenience of the parties, be permitted to revoke authorization for the deduction of Association dues only during the month of May for any year. Any request for such revocation shall be delivered in person to the Office of the Controller or may be sent by U.S. mail to the Controller, whose current address is 875 Stevenson Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. The City shall deliver a copy of any revocation notice to the Association not later than July 1.\nC. Agency Shop.\n\n35. 1. Application. The provisions of this section shall apply to all police officers of bargaining unit P-1.\n\n36. 2. Implementation. An agency shop shall be implemented within representation units or subunits when:\n\na. Election\n\n37. The Union has requested, in writing, an election on the issue, to be conducted by the State Conciliation Service and 50% plus one of those voting favor implementation of an agency shop, or\n\nb. 2/3 Membership\n\n38. The Union makes a showing that 2/3 of the employees within the unit or subunit are dues-paying members of the Union, or\n\nc. New Employees\n\n39. The Union requests, in writing, an agency shop be implemented for all employees hired after a date to be agreed to by the Union and the Employee Relations Division.\n\n40. 3. Service Fee. All police officers of bargaining unit P-1 except as set forth below, shall, as a condition of continued employment, become and remain a member of the Association, or in lieu thereof, shall pay a service fee to the Association. The fair share service fee payment shall be established annually by the Association, provided that such fair share agency shop service fee will be used by the Association only for the purposes permitted by law. The Association shall give all non-member employees of affected bargaining units written notice of their obligation to either join or pay an agency shop fee as a condition of employment. After such notice and a time period agreed to by the parties, service fees from non-members shall be collected by payroll deduction pursuant to Administrative Code Section 16.90. Failure to comply with this section shall be grounds for termination. The Association, at its option, may elect to waive its rights to demand termination and instead utilize judicial process to compel payment.\n\n41. 4. Financial Reporting. Annually, the Association will provide an explanation of the fee and sufficient financial information to enable the fair share service fee payer to gauge the appropriateness of the fee. The Association will provide a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker, not chosen by the Association, and will make provision for an escrow account to hold amounts reasonably in dispute while challenges are pending.\n42. 5. Religious Exemption. Any employee covered by this provision who is a member of a bona fide religion, body or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting a public employee organization and is recognized by the National Labor Relations Board to hold such objections to labor union membership shall, upon presentation of membership and historical objection, be relieved of any obligation to pay the required service fee. The Association shall be informed in writing of any such requests.\n\n43. 6. Payment of Sums Withheld. Nine (9) working days following payday, the City will promptly pay over to the Association, less the fee for making such deductions, all sums withheld for membership or service fees. The City shall also provide with each payment a list of employees paying such service fees.\n\n44. 7. Indemnification. The Association agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless for any loss or damage arising from the operation of this section.\n\n45. 8. The Union shall comply with the requirements set forth in Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986) for the deduction of agency shop fees. Annually, the Union shall certify in writing to the City that the content of the written notice meets the requirements set forth in this section and in Hudson.\n\nSection 8. Bulletin Boards and Distribution of Materials.\n\n46. A reasonable amount of space on bulletin boards within police buildings shall be made available for the dissemination of Association literature. All literature shall be dated, shall be identified by affiliation and author, and shall be neatly displayed, and removed from said bulletin board when no longer timely. The Department agrees that Association Literature shall not be removed from said bulletin boards without first consulting with the station, bureau, or unit representative of the Association to determine if the literature should remain for an additional period of time. The Department is authorized to remove any literature not posted within the specific limits of this section upon notifying the affected Association representative.\n\n47. Distribution of Association literature by any Association member shall be done so as not to interfere with or interrupt the performance of official police duties.\nARTICLE II. EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS\n\nSection 1.    Non-Discrimination.\n\n48. The City and the Association agree that no person employed or applying for employment shall in any way be discriminated against because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, physical handicap, age, political affiliation or opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation, nor shall such a person be the subject of sexual or racial harassment. This paragraph shall not be construed to restrict or proscribe voluntary affirmative action efforts by the Department; nor shall any rule, policy, procedure, order, action, determination or practice taken to ensure compliance with the purpose, goals, or requirements of a consent decree be restricted by the provisions of this paragraph.\n\n49. This section is not intended to affect the right of an employee to elect any applicable administrative remedy for discrimination proscribed herein. Provided, however, the parties agree that an employee may elect only one administrative remedy, except as provided in paragraph 52. It is understood that this paragraph shall not foreclose the election by an affected employee of any administrative or statutory remedy provided by law.\n\n50. The parties recognize that in a disciplinary proceeding, or any other context in which EEO issues are administratively determined by the City or the police department, the City does not represent individual police officers. Accordingly, the parties recognize the Association has a duty to fairly represent all of its members and that this duty applies to POA members who are complainants in discrimination cases, as well as to POA members who may be accused of discriminatory conduct.\n\n51. Neither the City nor the Association shall interfere with, intimidate, restrain, coerce or discriminate against any employee because of the exercise of rights granted pursuant to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.\n\n52. An employee who elects an administrative remedy other than the grievance procedure contained in this MOU for discrimination proscribed herein, and whose complaint is not resolved within thirty (30) days, shall have the right to seek relief in accord with the grievance procedure. In such instances, the employee may initiate his/her grievance at Step III.\n\n53. It is understood and agreed that any disciplinary action against an employee that may be initiated or result from the application or interpretation of these provisions shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article I, Section 5 of this Agreement. Any action grieved pursuant to this section and determined to be violative thereof may be set aside by the Chief of the Department or the Police Commission.\n\nSection 2.    Disabilities.\n\n54. The parties agree that they are required to provide reasonable accommodations for persons with\ndisabilities in order to comply with the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), the Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\") and all other applicable federal, state and local disability anti-discrimination statutes and further agree that this Memorandum will not be interpreted, administered or applied in any manner which is inconsistent with said statutes. The City reserves the right to take any action necessary to comply therewith.\n\nSection 3. Personnel Files.\n\n55. The City shall maintain personnel files for each employee. Employees or their authorized representatives have the right to examine the contents of their master personnel files maintained by the Personnel Division during business hours Monday through Friday excluding legal holidays. Adverse comments may not be placed in the employees\u2019 master personnel files without the employees\u2019 having acknowledged notice of the adverse comments on the face of the document prior to placement of the comments in the files. Employees may cause to be placed in their master personnel files responses to adverse material inserted therein and a reasonable amount of correspondence as determined by the Chief originating from other sources directly related to their job performance may be placed in employees\u2019 master personnel files.\n\n56. Only persons authorized by the Commanding Officer of the Personnel Division may review an employee\u2019s master personnel file.\n\n57. This section regarding employee access and authorized review applies to materials contained in files of cases classified as improper conduct in the Management Control Division and EEO Unit after the Chief determines to proceed with disciplinary action. All other access to the files at the Management Control Division and EEO Unit must be pursuant to a valid discovery motion filed and approved by the Police Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction except as provided in subsection D. below regarding sealed reprimands except where access is deemed by the City to pertain to investigations, EEO compliance, Consent Decrees or other legal or administrative proceedings.\n\n58. Formal reprimands without further penalty more than two (2) years old, and those with additional penalty more than five (5) years old, will not be considered for purposes of promotion, transfer or special assignments. All officers shall have the right to review their master personnel file and identify all such documents. Upon concurrence of the Commanding Officer of Personnel that such documents have been appropriately identified, they will be placed in an envelope, sealed and initialed by the officer. The envelope will be placed in the officer\u2019s personnel file and will be opened only in the event that the officer is in the future subject to discipline or access is deemed by the City to pertain to investigations, EEO compliance, Consent Decrees or other legal or administrative proceedings.\nSection 4. Rights of Individual Employees.\n\n59. An employee may not be disciplined or subjected to punitive action without written notice of the disciplinary action. The employee is entitled to receive a copy of the charges and material upon which the disciplinary action is based. This provision shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.\n\n60. The Employer agrees to use the principle of progressive discipline in the application of punitive action where appropriate. The Employer is not precluded from imposing suspension and/or termination if the facts so indicate without first imposing lesser forms of punitive action. This provision shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.\n\n61. The Department shall not subject an employee to examination by the Police Physician without informing the employee of the underlying reasons for the examination. Employees are entitled to have a person of the same sex designated by the Chief of Police present during any examination by the Police Physician. An employee may seek an opinion of another physician of his/her choice and at his/her own expense and this supplemental report of such physician is to be submitted to the Police Physician. The Police Physician must consider the supplemental information in making his recommendation to the Chief. The employee is entitled to receive a copy of the recommendation of the Police Physician\u2019s final report. The Chief of Police will make the final decision as to the recommendation filed by the Police Physician.\n\nSection 5. Access to Records of Office of Citizen Complaints.\n\n62. It is agreed that a complainant's Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC) complaint form shall be released to the complainant upon request.\n\n63. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Memorandum of Understanding, in the event an OCC investigative hearing is determined to be appropriate and is scheduled, the affected employee and the complainant, prior to said hearing and upon seventy-two (72) hours' advance notice, shall have access to all evidence not deemed to be confidential pursuant to the Police Commission rules. Such access shall consist of inspection of materials and, upon request, copies of materials for use by the employee and the complainant.\n\n64.

The OCC, in conjunction with the Police Commission, shall develop procedures which may utilize face-to-face dispute resolution in appropriate cases. Use of these procedures will be voluntary and subject to the veto power of the OCC for the complainant or the affected employee.\n\n67. Disputes regarding this section shall be resolved by utilization of existing rules and regulations and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nSection 6. Physical Fitness Program.\n\n68. The physical fitness program as set forth in General Order 11.10 and as outlined in the Physical Fitness Program Information Booklet (revised July, 1993) shall remain in effect, and shall be available to all employees covered under this MOU.\n\nSection 7. Pregnancy, Maternity and Family Care Leaves.\n\nA. Pregnancy Policy.\n\n69. The medical opinion of the employee\u2019s attending physician as to the length of time the employee can perform full duty without danger due to pregnancy will be honored subject to Civil Service Commission Rules.\n\n70. At the time the attending physician notifies the Department in writing requesting limited duty status for the pregnant employee, the employee will be released to limited duty consistent with Department policy.\n\n71. Pregnant employees may wear their civilian clothing or, with the approval of the Department, a uniform modified for pregnancy. There is no official Department maternity wear.\n\n72.

Objections to the seniority list shall be reported to the Chief on or before January 15 of each year.\n82. 1. Traffic Company Seniority. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, seniority within the Traffic Company shall first be based upon the date of assignment to the Traffic Company. Should officers be assigned on the same date, their seniority on the Department\u2019s DGO 11.06 list will be determinative.\n\n83. All objections shall be considered on their merits and appropriate actions shall be promptly taken.\n\n84. During the term of this Agreement, the parties will jointly establish a six-person committee consisting of three appointees from each side. The Committee shall meet and confer regarding changes to the existing P-1 process. The parties mutually agree that they shall exercise due diligence to bring those negotiations to prompt conclusion.

If an employee is transferred from one station to another by Department action, the employee\u2019s current watch choice continues until the next station sign-up.\n\n95. a. If an employee transfers to another station at his/her own request, he/she forfeits his/her right to a particular watch, and may have to wait for the next station sign-up. If more than one employee transfers to the same station, seniority shall apply to watch assignments for the interim period.\n\nD. Applicability of the Watch Sign-Ups.\n\n96. 1. The seniority watch sign-up policy will apply to assignments to watches as determined by the Commanding Officer's analysis of deployment needs and to the Community/Neighborhood Policing Program.\n\n97. 2. Employees who are reassigned to another watch as a result of the semiannual seniority watch sign-up shall be entitled to their original vacation selection based on prior sign-up.\n\n98. E. The District Station Commanding Officer shall have the authority to assign up to twelve (12) individual employees without regard to seniority at Mission, Central and Northern Stations, and up to nine (9) employees without regard to seniority at all other District Stations and up to five (5) for each of the two (2) Patrol Shifts at the Airport Bureau, for purposes of filling specialized and staff positions (i.e., permit investigation officer, school car, plain-clothes cars, special duty or community relations officer) but not limited to them, when it is necessary to have an individual assigned to a special unit which requires experience or other articulable qualifications possessed by the employee to be assigned, and which experience or qualifications would not be attained by filling the assignment by seniority.\n\n99. F. The District Commanding Officer may assign employees with the lowest qualifying seniority to another watch for the following reasons:\n\n100. 1. Agreement of officer after conducting a canvass of employees of the station or unit.\n101. 2. Need for non-probationary officers to work with probationary officers in order to field the platoon.\n\n102. 3. Employees who have a special need may be reassigned to another watch during the year based on need or unforeseen conditions which occurred after the semiannual watch sign-up.\n\nG.

K Solos and the Airport Bureau Solos.\n\n105. 2. For purpose of the bi-annual seniority sign-up, Solo Motorcycle Officers in Co. K and at the Airport Bureau will be treated as one unit.\n\n106. 3. The Airport Bureau Solo Motorcycle Officers shall have a unit seniority date of January 1, 2001 for the purposes, only, of the bi-annual seniority sign-up. These Officers shall have this unit seniority date for watch-sign purposes so long as they remain at the Airport Bureau.\n\n107. 4. In the event two Solo Motorcycle Officers from either Co. K or the Airport Bureau share the same unit seniority date, their departmental seniority date will be the tiebreaker for seniority sign-up purposes.\n\n108. 5. During each bi-annual seniority sign-up, Co. K will post its bid positions; then Airport Bureau will post its bid positions. Solo Motorcycle Officers, from either unit, may then sign-up for open positions in either unit on the basis of their unit seniority.\n\n109. 6. No employee of the Co. K Solo Motorcycle Unit or the Airport Bureau Solo Motorcycle Unit assigned to such unit prior to January 1, 2001, will be displaced from their unit as a result of the bi-annual seniority sign-up.\n\n110. 7. Consistent with past practice, any Solo Motorcycle Officers assigned in the future to either Co. K or the Airport Bureau will commence their unit seniority on the first day of their assignment.\n\n111. 8. Any future Solo Motorcycle Officer vacancies in either Co. K or the Airport Bureau will be offered to the next officer on the P-1 list. Any officer filling a vacancy from the P-1 list shall remain in that assignment until the next bi-annual seniority sign-up. At that time any such officer may exercise his or her unit seniority to fill any vacancy in either unit.\n112. H. Watch sign-ups are not final until five (5) calendar days prior to adoption.\n\nSection 12. Vacation Sign-Up.\n\n113. When using discretionary time-off, employees shall use accrued EH (Equivalent Holiday), FH (Floating Holiday), and/or PE (Physical Fitness Time) prior to using accrued VA (Vacation) and/or OU (Overtime Use). Employees who have reached maximum vacation time accrual limits are exempted from the application of this section.\n\n114. Employees at each station or unit shall, by watch, sign up by seniority for vacation on an annual basis prior to the first pay period in March of each year but in all cases after the first watch sign-up in any calendar year. An appropriate and sufficient number of vacation slots shall be made available so that all employees on a given watch may exercise their vacation rights.\n\n115. Additionally, time shall be provided on such vacation sign-up to allow employees, by reverse seniority, to sign up for one week of compensatory time-off.\n\n116. If an employee is transferred from one station or unit to another by Department action, his or her vacation choice shall continue. If an employee transfers to another station or unit by his or her request, the employee\u2019s choice of vacation may be forfeited based on staffing needs at the new assignment.\n\nSection 13. Filling Vacancies.\n\n117. When a vacancy occurs in a promotional rank, an eligible list exists for that rank, a position exists in the budget for the promotion and an appointment is made, the promotional appointment shall be made immediately on a permanent basis, provided such appointment is consistent with the consent decree.\n\nSection 14. Non-Emergency Special Event Assignments.\n\n118. This Department is frequently called upon to provide police services for one-time special events such as, but not limited to, parades, marathons, community festivals, and bicycle races. These events take place on City streets and usually require large numbers of police officers.\n\n119. In order to minimize the impact on the Department's ability to provide police services at the district stations, it is necessary to utilize off-duty personnel to augment the normal complement of officers assigned for duty on the day of the event. The EWW Overtime Fund is intended for this purpose.\n\n120. The Department shall determine the number of officers that are needed to police the special event and utilize the following:\n121.    1. On-duty personnel working their regular watch who can be spared from normal police duties within the district.\n\n122.    2. Officers Working EWW. This group will include officers working beyond their normal tour of duty and officers working their normal watch off.\n\n123. An employee\u2019s regular watch shall not be changed more than three (3) hours to avoid the payment of overtime in the policing of an event of this sort except that management may adjust regular watches up to seven (7) hours for July 4th, October 31st, and December 31st without incurring overtime costs.\n\n124. Specialized units in the Department (Tactical, Solos, Hondas, etc.) are an exception to this policy in that the very nature of their assignment requires flexible scheduling. EWW will be used for these units only if policing the event requires additional manpower beyond their normal operating complement.\n\n125. Employees who are called in to work during their normal watch off pursuant to this Section shall be granted a minimum of four (4) hours\u2019 pay (or compensatory time-off pursuant to Article III., Section 2 of this Agreement) at the applicable rate or shall be compensated for all hours actually worked at the applicable rate, whichever is greater. The Department will make every reasonable effort to call-in only those employees whose service is necessary for the special event, and shall release employees when their service is no longer reasonably required.\n\n126. A strict account will be made of each event utilizing EWW funds to ascertain actual cost for future reference.\n\n127. Before preparing any operations order, District Station Commanding Officers shall confer with the Chief\u2019s designee as to whether or not this Special Order covers a specific event scheduled to occur within their district.\n\nSection 15. Meals and Breaks During Demonstrations.\n\n128. The Department shall provide meals or a reasonable meal break time for employees assigned to special events where active duty thereat continues for more than four (4) consecutive hours. If the Department fails to or is unable to provide such meals, the Association may do so and will be reimbursed for the reasonable cost thereof on such occasions by the Department. This provision is subject to the development of procedures by the Department for the reimbursement for the cost of meals provided by the Association.\n\n129. The Department shall assure that employees have reasonable access to restroom facilities during special events where active duty thereat continues for more than four (4) consecutive hours.\nSection 16.  Courtesy Parking System for Court Attendance.\n\n130.

Of the two (2) complete sets, one (1) set shall be kept in the station equipment room which is accessible to the station keeper or his/her designee and made available to all employees.\n\n133. The Department will amend DGO 3.08 (Court Appearances by Members) to allow officers working a midnight shift (a ten hour shift beginning on or after 2100), to adjust their shift hours to accommodate a court appearance on the succeeding day, provided minimum staffing levels are met (i.e., an officer may adjust his or her shift from 2200-0800 to 2300-0900 or 0001-1000).\n\nSection 19.  Employee Training Reimbursement Program.\n\n134. The City will contribute five thousand dollars ($5,000) annually to the Employee Tuition Reimbursement Program for the exclusive use of employees covered under this MOU.\n\n135. Subject to available monies, an employee may submit a request for tuition reimbursement up to five-hundred dollars ($500) during each fiscal year.\n\nSection 20.  Medal of Valor Awards Ceremony.\n\n136. The City acknowledges the authority of the Police Commission to honor bargaining unit members with formal awards for outstanding service, above and beyond the call of duty. Such awards shall include, but are not limited to, Medals of Valor, Meritorious Conduct and Police Commission Commendations. Such awards shall be presented at an awards ceremony. The cost of each ceremony shall not exceed $3,000 and the cost per Fiscal Year shall not exceed $6,000.\nARTICLE III. PAY, HOURS AND BENEFITS\n\nSection 1. Wages.\n\nA.

This order supersedes Information Bulletin #86-133, and all other Bulletins, Orders, Policies or Procedures regarding modified duty and reasonable accommodation. This order contains the Department's entire modified duty and reasonable accommodation policy. This order is intended to be consistent with any rights members may have under law, including without limitation, workers compensation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.\n\nExcept for matters related to compensation while engaged in temporary modified duty assignments, nothing in this general order, and no decisions made pursuant to this general order, shall be grievable under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Police Officers' Association and the City.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. This Department is charged with the duty to protect life and property, to maintain the peace, to prevent crime, to enforce criminal laws and ordinances. These duties are best accomplished when all members are capable of performing the essential functions of their positions. Additionally, the Department's staffing has been impacted by the amendment to the Charter regarding minimum staffing of the Department.\n\nB. This policy has two parts. First, it outlines the temporary modified duty assignments for members who are temporarily injured or ill. Second, it describes the procedure for members to seek accommodation under State and Federal disabilities laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.\n\nII. TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY POLICY\n\nThe temporary modified duty policy allows sworn members who have a temporary illness or injury to continue to serve in the Department when they are unable to perform the essential functions of their position.\n\nA. ELIGIBILITY FOR TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS\n\n1. With the approval of the Chief of Police or his or her designee, a member who sustains a temporary injury or illness and who is thereby limited from performing the essential functions of his or her position may be provided a temporary modified duty assignment.\n\n2. This temporary modified duty policy applies only to sworn members of the Department (hereinafter referred to as \"members\"). It does not apply to civilian employees or employees in the academy. Probationary employees are eligible to the extent that they can complete all probation requirements within the time period set forth in the current Memorandum of Understanding between the City and the Police Officers' Association.\nB. DURATION OF TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS\n\n1. Limited To 365 Days. Temporary modified duty assignments shall be limited in duration to a maximum of 365 days. At the end of 30 days of a temporary modified duty assignment, or earlier if warranted, a member shall be reviewed by the Staff Services Division to determine whether the member will be able to return to his or her regular assignment. If the modified assignment extends beyond 30 days, the member's status will be reviewed every 30 days up to the maximum 365-day duration. Approximately 90 days prior to the expiration of the 365 day temporary modified duty assignment, the Department will notify members of the options set forth in subsection 3. below. Prior to the expiration of the 365 day temporary modified duty assignment, the Department will consider and discuss with those members the options set forth in subsection 3. below.\n\n2. Available Only If Members May Return To Regular Position.

RULES GOVERNING TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS\n\n1. Temporary modified duty assignments are those assignments within the Department that can be performed by members who temporarily cannot perform the essential functions of their position.\n\n2. Temporary modified duty assignments available to members will be subject to the following limitations:\n\na. Members will not be placed at district stations unless otherwise authorized by the Deputy Chief of Administration, and approved by the Chief of Police. These assignments shall be reviewed every 30 days.\n\nb. Members in temporary modified duty assignments shall be eligible for premium pay such as like work-like pay and overtime assignments, including but not limited to PLES overtime, as long as such assignments are consistent with the member's medical restrictions and the needs of the Department. Disputes about this issue will be submitted to the Deputy Chief of Administration for determination.\n\nc. Any involuntary transfer or reassignment shall require 48 hours notice, absent an emergency.\n\n3. No sworn member shall be given a temporary modified duty assignment in a budgeted non-sworn position.\n\nD. PROCESS FOR RECEIVING A TEMPORARY MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENT\n\n1. The process for receiving a temporary modified duty assignment begins either when the Department receives: (1) notification from Workers' Compensation Division that a member with an industrial injury may return to work in a modified duty capacity; or (2) a memorandum from a member with a non-industrial injury requesting to return to work in a temporary modified-duty capacity.\n\n2. The member's medical work restrictions are reviewed at the Staff Services Division, which shall compare the limitation(s) placed on the member by his or her treating physician with available temporary modified duty assignments. The Department may review the limitation(s) placed on the member by his or her treating physician with the City's independent medical expert and/or the Department Physician.\n3. In the event of questions regarding a member's ability to perform (1) the essential functions of a member's position, or (2) modified duties, the Department shall contact the member's treating physician and/or the City's medical expert for clarification. For industrial injuries, if there is a dispute over this issue, a final determination will be made in accordance with Workers' Compensation Rules.\n\n4. The Deputy Chief of Administration may make a recommendation for a temporary modified duty assignment to the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police shall make the final decision regarding the availability of a temporary modified duty assignment, based on the member's medical restrictions and the personnel needs of the Department. His or her decision shall also take into consideration the member's job skills, job qualifications, training, experience, and any other relevant factors.\n\n5. If a member is placed in a temporary modified duty assignment, he or she will be required to sign an acknowledgment confirming that he or she understands this policy, including its time limits, and agrees to abide by it.\n\nIII. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION\n\nA. POLICY. Members may request a reasonable accommodation when they have a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities. This impairment may or may not be as a result of a work-related incident. A copy of the City's \"Employee Information Sheet Regarding CCSF Reasonable Accommodation Process\" is available through the Department's ADA coordinator.\n\nB. REQUESTING A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. To request a reasonable accommodation, a member shall contact the Department's ADA coordinator and complete a request for accommodation form and a medical release. The ADA coordinator will engage in the interactive process with the member, and will review whether any reasonable accommodation is possible in the member's position.\n\nC. ADA COORDINATOR RECOMMENDATION. Without disclosing confidential medical information, the ADA coordinator shall present the member's restrictions and a recommendation regarding reasonable accommodation to the Duty Evaluation Committee.\n\nIV. DUTY EVALUATION COMMITTEE.\n\nA. The Duty Evaluation Committee shall be composed of the following members: the Deputy Chief of Administration Bureau (Chair), the Commanding Officer of the Staff Services Division, the Personnel Sergeant, the Police Physician, and the Department's ADA Coordinator.\nDGO 11.12\nRev. 01/07/04\n\nB. The Committee shall convene within 30 days of the receipt of the ADA coordinator's recommendation or sooner at the request of the member. At the meeting, the member requesting accommodation is entitled to be present and be represented by the Police Officers' Association or any other representative chosen by the member. The Committee shall consider the following:\n\n1. The nature, extent and seriousness of the member's restrictions, i.e., whether the member has restrictions that limit one or more major life activities.\n\n2. Whether the member, with reasonable accommodation, could perform the essential functions of his or her full-duty position, including through such methods as restructuring nonessential functions, or other means which do not pose an undue hardship to the Department or pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the members and others.\n\n3. When the Committee determines that a member cannot be reasonably accommodated to perform the essential job functions of his or her sworn position, the ADA coordinator shall refer the member to the Department of Human Resources for a 60 day concurrent Department; and City-wide search for job vacancies which meet the member's medical restrictions and for which the member meets the minimum qualifications. The member may elect not to participate in the Citywide search by notifying the Department of this election in writing.\n\n4. In addition, when the Committee determines that a member cannot be reasonably accommodated to perform the essential job functions of his or her sworn position, the Committee will consider and discuss with the member one of the following options: (1) recommending disability retirement; (2) providing an unpaid leave of absence pursuant to the Civil Service Rules; (3) allowing sick leave or FMLA leave; or (4) initiating non-punitive medical separation if none of the above are appropriate, and the member has not been placed in another position pursuant to the 60 day concurrent Department; and City-wide search for job vacancies.\n\n5. In determining whether to recommend a member for ordinary or industrial disability retirement, the Committee shall consider any or all of the following: Workers Compensation Appeals Board determination(s), Disability Evaluation Unit rating(s), nature and extent of medical restrictions or limitations, body part(s) affected, length of service, and relevant medical reports.\n\n6. The Duty Evaluation Committee will consider the factors above, and will not consider a member's refusal to participate in the Citywide search or to accept an offered non-sworn position.\n\n7. Based on all of the above, the Duty Evaluation Committee shall make a determination and shall communicate that to the member in a timely fashion.\nDGO 11.12\nRev. 01/07/04\n\nC. REVIEW TO CHIEF OF POLICE. If the member disagrees with the determination of the Duty Evaluation Committee, the member may request a review of the Committee's determination by the Chief of Police.\n\nD. ACCOMMODATION IN NON-SWORN POSITION. No member shall be granted an accommodation in a budgeted non-sworn position, unless the position is vacant and the member received a disability transfer to that position pursuant to City policy.\nAPPENDIX C\n\nSan Francisco Police Department\nGENERAL ORDER\n10.01\n08/10/94\n\nUNIFORM AND EQUIPMENT CLASSES\n\nThis order identifies the Department's uniform classes and specifies the uniform and equipment items within each class.\n\nI.
