The City shall continue to provide a wellness program as follows:

246. 1. Employees must establish and maintain a core bank of sick leave hours in order to qualify for the wellness program. That core bank shall be a minimum of three hundred (300) hours.

247. 2. Once an employee has established their core bank of sick leave hours (as provided in (a) above) they shall be entitled to an annual conversion of sick leave hours for cash out payment under the above conditions. If an employee utilizes thirty (30) hours or less of sick leave in a fiscal year, they shall be entitled to cash out up to one hundred (100) hours accrued during that fiscal year. If an employee utilized more than thirty (30) hours of sick leave in a fiscal year, they are not eligible for any sick leave cash out. Sick leave hours donated to catastrophic sick leave bank(s) or used for authorized bereavement leave according to the Civil Service Rules shall not be considered sick leave utilization for purposes of this paragraph.

248. 3. Payment of the cash out shall take place on annual basis on the pay period closest to June 1 for each remaining fiscal year of this Agreement.

249. 4. The aforesaid payments shall not be considered as part of an employee's salary for the purpose of computing retirement benefits or retirement contributions.

B. Pilot "wellness incentive program" to promote workforce attendance:

250. A full-time employee leaving the employment of the City upon service or disability retirement may receive payment of a portion of accrued sick leave credits at the time of separation.

251. The amount of this payment shall be equal to two-and-one-half percent (2.5%) of accrued sick leave credits at the time of separation times the number of whole years of continuous employment times an employee's salary rate, exclusive of premiums or supplements, at the time of separation. Vested sick leave credits, as set forth under Civil Service Commission Rules, shall not be included in this computation and shall be compensated pursuant to those Rules.

252. Example of Calculation

Employee A retires with 20 years of service.
Employee A has a sick leave balance of 500 hours.
Employee A has a base salary rate of $25.00 per hour at the time of separation.

Wellness Incentive = 2.5% for each year of service x 20 years of service = 50%
50% x 500 hours = 250 hours.
250 hours x $25.00 (base salary at time of separation) = $6,250.00

253. The number of hours for which an employee may receive cash payments shall not exceed
