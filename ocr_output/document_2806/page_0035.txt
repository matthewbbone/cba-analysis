Section 6.    Acting Assignment Pay (Like Pay for Like Work).

Eligibility for acting assignment pay will be determined as follows:

216. A. Unless otherwise authorized by the commanding officer, night supervising captain or weekend duty captain, the person whose position is being filled must be on paid leave for a full watch: VA, SP, OU, DP, EH or FH during the date and time period. If the commanding officer, night supervising captain or weekend duty captain determines a position is to be filled temporarily by an employee in the next lower rank, the employee filling that position shall be compensated at the salary of the rank being filled for the time worked.

217. B. Commissioned officers who are required to perform duties of the next highest rank are not entitled to receive acting assignment pay compensation unless they receive prior approval from the Deputy Chief of the employee’s respective bureau. If the deputy chief of the employee’s respective bureau determines a position is to be filled temporarily by an employee in the next lower rank, the employee filling that position shall be compensated at the salary of the rank being filled for the time worked.

218. C. The employee filling a position must be permanent in the Police Officer or Sergeant ranks (or Inspector rank if the employee is filling a position in the Investigation Bureau). Absent the commanding officer being able to articulate specific reasons for not selecting the senior employee, seniority in rank shall control. The Chief of Police, however, may designate officers (including commissioned officers), pending temporary provisional appointment, to temporarily fill vacancies caused by officers in the next highest rank who are off on long term paid leave status or have retired.

219. 1. The City and the Association agree, for all hours between 0200 and 0600 when no Lieutenant is scheduled to work, the Sergeant assigned to fill the Lieutenant position pursuant to subsection C. will be compensated at the Lieutenant rate. No Police Officer, however, will be permitted to fill the position of the Sergeant serving as a Lieutenant between the hours of 0200 and 0600.

220. D. The division commander or the deputy chief must approve filling the position in advance.

221. E. An employee entitled to receive acting assignment pay compensation must complete a “Compensation Request/Equal Pay” (SFPD 319) card for the hours actually worked and submit the card to Payroll by the end of the pay period.

222. F. The completed card must include the name and rank of the person replaced, if any, the beginning and ending dates and times of the acting assignment pay status and the actual dates circled on the back of the card.

223. All of the above conditions must be met before acting assignment compensation can be approved. In the normal absence of a superior officer, the senior ranking officer on duty will be in charge, but will not be expected to perform the duties of the higher rank.
