CLASSIFICATION AND POSITION AUDIT SYSTEM

Section 1.
The classification of positions within Montgomery County, the duties assigned to those positions, and the methodology used for classification is vested with Management. When a new job classification is established or an existing one is substantially changed, the County will submit the description in writing and meet with the Union to discuss said changes at least fifteen (15) days prior to implementation of those changes. Within thirty (30) days the parties will meet to negotiate the rate of pay for the job. If no agreement on rate of pay can be reached between the parties, they will submit it to the grievance procedure at the third step before a mutually agreed upon neutral hearing officer. Among the factors to be considered in resolving the dispute are the skill, knowledge, and abilities required in the position and the problem-solving, know-how, accountability and working conditions in the position all in relationship to other positions in the classification system.

Section 2.
The rate of pay assigned to each new classification within the County shall be assigned in accordance with the County Compensation Plan.

Section 3.
The Union may request a position audit to be performed by the County on behalf of any individual or group of individuals. The results of the position audit and/or the content of a job are not subject to the grievance procedure. No position will be audited more than once in any twelve (12) month period. Position audits shall be completed ninety (90) calendar days from the date of their request.
