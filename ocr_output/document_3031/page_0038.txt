ARTICLE 32
EVALUATIONS AND MERIT INCREASES

Section 1.
All employees in the County will be evaluated at least once annually, approximately thirty (30) days prior to anniversary date.

Section 2.
Both the employee and the supervisor shall participate in the evaluations. The employee shall be given an opportunity to examine all evaluations and discuss his/her evaluation with his/her immediate supervisor and to sign the evaluation form to indicate that he/she has done so; although his/her signature on the form does not necessarily indicate his/her agreement with the evaluation. In event an employee refuses to sign an evaluation form, the supervisor and the employee may each call another employee as a witness to the refusal to sign and shall serve as a witness to the employee's refusal to sign the form. Any additional comments, statements, or objections by the employee to the evaluation may be submitted on attached memorandum; and the presence of such attachment must be noted on the evaluation form itself for the employee, and become a permanent part of that employee's record. The employee shall receive a copy of the evaluation at that time and the evaluation shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. Once an employee has signed the evaluation form, Management shall not make any further changes.

Section 3.
Less than satisfactory evaluations must be preceded by least a written notice given when the employee performance falls below acceptable standards. The notice will specify the areas in which the performance is not satisfactory.

Section 4.
* Generally, employees are eligible for step increases upon satisfactory performance, on the anniversary date following a satisfactory evaluation. However, moratorium on merit increases and movement to the next step in the progressive pay plan is in effect for 2004.* If an employee receives a less than satisfactory evaluation, it may be appealed at the third step within five (5) working days of receipt of the evaluation.
