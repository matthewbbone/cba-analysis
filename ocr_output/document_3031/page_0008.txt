to pay the Union a Fair Share fee as a condition of employment as permitted by the provisions of Section 4117.09 (C) of the Ohio Revised Code. The deduction of the Fair Share fee from any earnings of the employee shall be automatic and does not require a written authorization for payroll deduction. The Fair Share fee amount shall be certified to the County by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring any employee in the bargaining unit to become a member of the Union as a condition for serving or retaining employment or any benefits under this Agreement. The Union will indemnify, save, and hold the County and its agents and employees harmless from any action growing out of deductions hereunder and commenced by an employee or anyone else against the County or the County and the Union jointly.

The Union agrees to establish a Fair Share fee procedure in compliance with Chapter 4117 of the Ohio Revised Code and Federal law. In addition, the Union will provide the County's designated representative for collective bargaining with a copy of the Union's Fair Share fee procedure.

The County will deduct from the wages the regular biweekly Union dues of members and the Fair Share fees of non-members. In the event an employee's pay is insufficient for the deduction, the County will deduct the amount from the employee's next regular pay where the amount earned is sufficient. All deductions shall be transmitted to the proper officers of the Union no later than fifteen (15) days following the end of the pay period in which the deduction is made, and upon receipt, the Union shall assume full responsibility for the disposition of all funds deducted.

The County shall provide with each deduction of dues and Fair Share fee deductions, the following information:

A. Alphabetical list of Union members from whom deductions were made, the name, address, social security number of each member and the amount deducted;

B. Alphabetical list of Fair Share fee employees from whom deductions were made, the name, address, social security number of each employee and the amount deducted;

C. The name of each Union member and Fair Share fee employee whose name has been dropped from the prior check-off list and the reason for the omission.
