Service in the armed forces of the United States is a privilege and a duty that all citizens should participate in when called upon. Therefore, the Montgomery County Board of County Commissioners shall not refuse to employ nor discharge an employee because of military membership. Employees "in service" will not be prevented from performing duties when called upon.

An employee who is a member of the Ohio National Guard, the Ohio Defense Corps, the Ohio Naval militia, or is a member of another reserve unit of the armed forces, or is serving in the United States Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marines should be aware of the following:

1. A leave of absence to receive a physical examination or be inducted into the military can be granted if the employee submits a written request for such leave and notification to report to the supervisor before departing for duty. If sick leave time is available, an employee may use up to three (3) days of paid leave for this purpose.

2. Military personnel are entitled to a short-term leave of absence with pay for periods not to exceed 31 calendar and/or 22 working days each calendar year plus up to three (3) travel days if necessary.

3. During this period of thirty-one (31) calendar days and/or twenty-two (22) working days or less of service, the employee may also receive pay for military service with no effect on pay from the County. The employee is required to submit a copy of military orders or other statements in writing from the appropriate military authority as evidence of a call to service.

The time an employee serves on short-term leave of absence for military service will be counted as full service time when computing vacation or sick leave credits.

4. If an employee serves in an "active duty" status for more than 22 working days or 31 calendar days, he/she will be considered to be long-term military leave of absence without pay. Employees must have been working for Montgomery County for at least 90 calendar days to be granted this status.

The employee on long-term military leave will receive the difference between his/her gross monthly wage or salary as a County employee and the sum of his/her gross uniformed pay and allowances received that month, for a period not to exceed three hundred and sixty-five (365) calendar days, including the short-term leave period. Vacation and sick leave hours benefits will not be accrued during a long-term military leave of absence without pay. However, for purposes of retirement and seniority, time in active duty will be accredited to the employee's service record in accordance with Paragraph 5.

5. If an employee has been on long-term military leave of absence and is then separated or discharged under honorable conditions from the service, he/she may, through the Human Resources Director, request reemployment with Montgomery County. This request must be in writing and must be submitted within 90 calendar days of release from active duty. The County will then return him/her to either his/her former position or one of like responsibility with full seniority rights, wage adjustments, step increases or other benefits that would have been due as though he/she had been actively employed at the County.

6. All other benefits will be granted in accordance with applicable policies and procedures instituted by Management.

Section 7.
Legal Process Section

Employees shall be paid at their regular rate of pay for time spent in jury duty or as a witness subpoenaed to offer in an action in which said employee is not a party to the action provided that all compensation received from a court for jury service or for witness fees shall be paid by the employee to the County Treasurer. An employee shall not be compensated for time spent on leave granted to pursue legal action either as a plaintiff or a defendant.
