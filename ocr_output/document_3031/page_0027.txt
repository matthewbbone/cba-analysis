VACATION AND PERSONAL LEAVE

Section 1. Vacation leave shall accrue to the employee upon each successive annual recurrence of the anniversary date of his/her employment. Days specified as holidays in this Agreement shall not be charged to an employee's vacation leave. Vacation leave shall be taken by the employee during the year in which it accrued and prior to the next recurrence of the anniversary date of his/her employment provided the appointing authority may, in special and meritorious cases, permit such employee to accumulate and carry over his/her accrued vacation leave to the following year. No accrued vacation leave shall be carried over for more than three (3) years. An employee is entitled to compensation at his/her current rate of pay for the prorated portion of any earned but unused vacation leave for the current year to his/her credit at time of separation; and in addition, shall be compensated for any unused vacation leave accrued to his/her credit, with the permission of the appointing authority, for the three (3) years immediately preceding the last anniversary date.

One (1) year of service shall be computed on the basis of twenty-six (26) bi-weekly pay periods. All regular full-time employees shall be granted the following vacation leave with full pay each year based upon their length of service with the County and other political subdivision of the State:
