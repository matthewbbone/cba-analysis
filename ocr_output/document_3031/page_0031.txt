Section 3.
Work-Related Injury

A. An employee shall receive his/her regular day's pay for the date on which he/she was injured, when such injury occurred in the performance of his/her job and when there was no negligence on the part of the employee resulting in his/her injury.

B. Effective January 1, 1993, an employee absent from work because of any service connected occupational illness or injury, as determined by the Industrial Commission, shall be entitled to reinstatement at the same rate of pay he/she received prior to the date of such illness or injury, upon approval of his/her application to return to work. Such application shall be made within one (1) year following the date of the injury. This period may be extended with the approval of Management and upon the advice of competent medical authority. Seniority rights will continue to accumulate during such absence.

It is the responsibility of the injured employee to inform Management of the estimated length of his/her absence, as determined by the treating physician. This notification shall be made in a timely manner, and in any event shall not exceed two (2) weeks following said injury. If an estimation of such absence cannot be made by the treating physician, then the employee is required to report to his/her immediate supervisor either by phone or by letter, on a bi-weekly basis until an estimated time of absence can be ascertained.

C. Effective January 1, 1993, if an employee misses work because of a work-related injury, he/she shall receive wage continuation during the twelve (12) weeks immediately following the injury or until he/she is physically able to return to work, whichever is earlier. Wage continuation will only be paid for any time period for which the employee would be eligible for worker's compensation benefits. An injured employee will reimburse the County for any wage continuation payments which are later determined to have been improperly made, for any reason. Payment of wage continuation under this section will be computed on the basis of the employee's base rate of pay. If the employee has not returned to work at the end of the twelve (12) week period, wage continuation will cease and the employee will receive temporary total compensation from the Bureau of Workers' Compensation. The employee may elect to use accrued sick leave in accordance with Montgomery County's sick leave provisions for any time period for which he/she is not currently eligible for wage continuation or workers' compensation benefits.

Additionally, the injured employee may elect to use accrued sick leave after wage continuation ceases. In no event, however, will the employee be permitted to buy back sick leave. An injured employee cannot concurrently receive sick leave or wage continuation and temporary total compensation payments.

In accordance with Montgomery County policy and procedures; in order to qualify for wage continuation, the employee must:
