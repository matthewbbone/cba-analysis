ARTICLE 8

SENIORITY

Section 1.
Seniority shall, for the purpose of this Agreement, be defined as an employee's length of continuous full-time service since their last date of hire, including time on leave of absence without pay for illness or injury. Time spent on a leave of absence without pay in excess of fourteen (14) days, for reasons other than illness or injury shall not be credited towards the accumulation of seniority, except as specified in Article 27, Leave of Absence.

Section 2.
Seniority does not apply and shall not be required to be used as a determining factor in assigning particular types of work to employees within a position classification or in assigning employees machines, equipment or places of work.

Section 3.
Seniority and the employment relationship shall be terminated when an employee:
(a) quits; or
(b) is discharged for just cause; or
(c) is laid off for a period in excess of twenty-four (24) months.

Section 4.
Three (3) months after the computerized personnel system is installed and operating and every three (3) months thereafter, the County shall post on all bulletin boards a seniority list showing the continuous service of each bargaining unit member. A copy of the seniority list shall be furnished to the Union when it is posted.

Section 5.
Probation and Probationary Periods
All new employees, including rehired employees, shall be considered as probationary employees and must successfully complete an initial probationary period before attaining regular employee status. Any regular employee who is voluntarily transferred (other than on a temporary basis), or promoted shall be considered as a special probationary employee, and must successfully complete a special probationary period as specified herein before being appointed to the new or related position classification. All probationary employees, including special probationary employees, shall receive an employee evaluation on or near the midpoint of their probationary period.

A.
Each newly hired employee becomes an initial probationary employee upon the date of their employment and remains so until they have successfully completed their required initial probationary period. The required initial probationary period shall be one hundred twenty (120) days except for professional employees and all Job and Family Services employees and the classifications of Animal Care and Control Officer and Animal Care Provider whose initial probationary period will be one hundred eighty (180) days.

The initial probationary period required above represents a total cumulative service time, and may be adjusted upward so as to properly allow for any authorized leaves of absence or other approved breaks in service.

During the initial probationary period, the probationary employee may be disciplined, discharged, laid off, or otherwise dismissed at the sole discretion of the County and neither the reason for nor the disciplinary action, discharge, lay-off, or dismissal may be subject of a grievance.

In the case of lay-off, bumping and recall, there shall be no seniority among initial probationary employees. Upon the successful completion of the initial probationary period, however, the employee shall attain regular employee status and receive all benefits normally afforded to regular employees, including seniority. Employees shall acquire seniority credit, and their seniority shall be retroactive to the date of employment, less any adjustments.

B.
Any regular employee who is voluntarily transferred (other than on a temporary basis), promoted, or given a lateral classification change becomes a
