ARTICLE 30

HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

Section 1.
The normally scheduled hours of work shall consist of eight (8) hours in approximately two segments plus that time for an unpaid lunch period in between, five (5) days a week, Monday through Friday, except where there is a continuous twenty-four (24) hour per day operation or where there is a continuous seven (7) day a week operation made necessary because of the nature of the work.

Section 2.
The County shall pay overtime at the rate of time and one-half of the regular straight time hourly rate (including shift differential) for all required overtime worked by hourly rated employees in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week. The County shall pay overtime at the rate of time and one-half of the regular straight time hourly rate (including shift differential) for all required overtime worked by Stillwater Center or Country View Manor employees in excess of eight (8) hours per day or eighty (80) hours bi-weekly. Overtime is time worked continuous to the regular work schedule whether it precedes or follows that shift.

Section 3.
Management shall endeavor to distribute authorized overtime among all employees in each classification within a department on a non-preferential and equal basis. The County shall establish a rotating seniority list by job classifications, within each division, for overtime assignments when overtime work is necessary. The list shall begin with the most senior person in the job classification. Management shall request the employee's name who appears first on the list to work overtime when overtime is available. When the employee is unable to work the overtime which has been offered to him/her, the employee shall not be offered overtime until his/her name again appears at the top of the list. The rotating seniority list for overtime shall apply to emergency overtime when practicable and shall not apply to regularly scheduled overtime and hold-over overtime. Management reserves the right to require overtime for employees. Should it be necessary to require overtime, Management will begin assignments with the least senior employee in each job classification where overtime is worked and rotate such assignments from a list which begins with the least senior employee. When possible, Management shall give a twenty-four (24) hour notice of required overtime.

Section 4.
Overtime premiums shall not be-pyramided, compounded or paid twice for the same time worked.

Section 5.
Employees who have worked overtime for which they are entitled to pay at the rate of time and one-half may take compensatory time at the rate of time and one-half in lieu of pay at the overtime rate. Employees shall be permitted to take compensatory time within six (6) months from the date it was earned. Employees may not earn in excess of forty (40) hours (40 hours times one and one half hours) of compensatory time in a calendar year.

Section 6.
All authorized overtime hours worked by employees shall be recorded daily, and a list of employees and overtime shall be prepared on a bi-weekly basis by supervisor. This list shall be available to all affected employees; stewards may review bargaining unit members' overtime list upon request.

Section 7.
Call-in pay is payment for emergency work performed by an employee who has been recalled to work at a time disconnected with his/her normally scheduled work hours. Work done in this manner shall be compensated with a minimum of two (2) hours pay at a rate of time and one-half. If an employee is called in between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., he/she shall be compensated with a minimum of three (3) hours pay at the rate of time and one-half.

Section 8.
Paid vacation time, compensatory time, injury leave time, personal leave, funeral leave and paid holidays shall not be counted as time worked for the purposes of computing entitlement to time and one-half overtime.

Section 9.
Flextime
Each department may request discussions with the Union if the department believes that a work schedule other than five (5) eight (8) hour days is in the best interest of the majority of employees in the department; e.g., four (4) or ten (10) hour days. If a department changes the number of hours worked in a day, it shall be with a majority of affected employees' and the Union's mutual consent, and the number of hours scheduled for the day (such as ten
