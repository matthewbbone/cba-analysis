Section 5.
Probation and Probationary Periods
All new employees, including rehired employees, shall be considered as probationary employees and must successfully complete an initial probationary period before attaining regular employee status. Any regular employee who is voluntarily transferred (other than on a temporary basis), or promoted shall be considered as a special probationary employee, and must successfully complete a special probationary period as specified herein before being appointed to the new or related position classification. All probationary employees, including special probationary employees, shall receive an employee evaluation on or near the midpoint of their probationary period.

A.
Each newly hired employee becomes an initial probationary employee upon the date of their employment and remains so until they have successfully completed their required initial probationary period. The required initial probationary period shall be one hundred twenty (120) days except for professional employees and all Job and Family Services employees and the classifications of Animal Care and Control Officer and Animal Care Provider whose initial probationary period will be one hundred eighty (180) days.

The initial probationary period required above represents a total cumulative service time, and may be adjusted upward so as to properly allow for any authorized leaves of absence or other approved breaks in service.

During the initial probationary period, the probationary employee may be disciplined, discharged, laid off, or otherwise dismissed at the sole discretion of the County and neither the reason for nor the disciplinary action, discharge, lay-off, or dismissal may be subject of a grievance.

In the case of lay-off, bumping and recall, there shall be no seniority among initial probationary employees. Upon the successful completion of the initial probationary period, however, the employee shall attain regular employee status and receive all benefits normally afforded to regular employees, including seniority. Employees shall acquire seniority credit, and their seniority shall be retroactive to the date of employment, less any adjustments.

B.
Any regular employee who is voluntarily transferred (other than on a temporary basis), promoted, or given a lateral classification change becomes a
special probationary employee upon the date of the transfer, promotion, or lateral classification change and remains so until they have successfully completed a required special probationary period. These special probationary periods shall be as set forth below:

1. Transferred employees (voluntary): sixty (60) days.
   (Mandatory transfers do not require probation.)

2. Promoted or lateral classification change employees:
   a. one hundred twenty (120) days except for professional employees whose probationary period is one hundred eighty (180) days.

   b. All Job and Family Services promotional or lateral classification change probationary periods shall be one hundred eighty (180) days.

   c. The classifications of Animal Care and Control Officer and Animal Care Provider shall have a probationary period of 180 days.

The special probationary periods required above represent a total cumulative service time, and they may be adjusted upward so as to properly allow for any authorized leaves of absence or other approved breaks in service.

If the special probationary employee fails to demonstrate that he/she can completely and satisfactorily perform the job within the special probationary period, the County shall return the employee to his/her former position classification, without any loss in seniority. Any other employees who were transferred, promoted or received a lateral classification change following and as a result of this employee's transfer, promotion, or lateral classification change shall also be returned to their former positions, and unless there is a lay-off involved, the bumping procedure shall not apply.

C. It is agreed that all persons in an initial probationary status are excluded from coverage of this Agreement.

Section 6.
When a demotion occurs, job classification seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous service in a classification beginning with the last date of entry into the classification except as stipulated in Section 5, Probation and Probationary Periods.
ARTICLE 9

LAY-OFF AND RECALL

Section 1.
Lay Off/Abolishment

The County, in its discretion, shall determine whether lay-offs are necessary and within which classifications lay-offs will occur. Although not limited to the following, lay-offs shall ordinarily be for lack of work and/or lack of funds. If the County determines that positions are to be abolished, employees losing their jobs because of such abolishment shall be given the same rights as laid-off employees. The County may not lay-off employees for disciplinary reasons or for arbitrary and capricious reasons.

Employees will be laid off from the affected classification in accordance to their overall seniority and their present ability to perform the remaining work available without further formal training. When seniority is equal, the employee with the lowest last four digits in his/her social security number will be laid off first. Affected employees will be given ten (10) working days notice of a lay-off.

Section 2.
Displacement Rights

An employee whose position is abolished, who is subject to lay off, or who is displaced as a result of lay off/abolishment shall have the right to fill an available vacancy in the same classification or lower classification within the classification series within the lay off district. If there are no current vacant positions in the classification, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the same classification. If the employee has no right to displace within the classification and there exists lower classifications within a class series, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the next or subsequently lower classifications within the classification series. Retention points shall be based upon seniority only.

Section 3.
Recall

Employees who are laid off shall be placed on a recall list for a period of twenty-four (24) months. If there is a recall, employees who are still on the recall list shall be recalled in the inverse order of their lay-off, provided they are presently qualified to perform the work in the job classification to which they are recalled without further training.

If an employee is recalled to a position in a lower rated job classification, he/she shall have the right to return to the job classification he/she held prior to being laid off in the event it subsequently becomes available. If an employee is recalled to a lower rated job classification, the employee shall have the right to refuse the recall. The County shall not hire new employees in affected bargaining unit positions as long as there are still employees on the recall list who are presently qualified to perform the work in the affected job classification and are willing to be recalled to said classification.

Employees who are eligible for recall shall be given fourteen (14) calendar days notice of recall and notice of recall shall be sent to the employee by certified or registered mail with a copy to the Union. The employee must notify the Agency Head of his/her intention to return within three (3) days after receiving notice of recall. The County shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations by mailing the recall notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address provided by the employee, it being the obligation and responsibility of the employee to provide the Agency Head with his/her latest mailing address.

Section 4.
Lay Off Districts:

The County shall be divided into five lay-off districts.

1. Sanitary Engineering Department
2. Public Works Department
3. Job and Family Services Department
4. Stillwater Center and Country View Manor
5. All other Departments under the Board of County Commissioners.

Section 5. COBRA

Employees who are terminated (except for gross misconduct) may purchase the County's health care benefits covered in Article 28 for eighteen (18) months after date of termination. Arrangements for payment shall be made between the employee and the payroll department prior to the effective date of termination.

ARTICLE 10

Section 3.
The employee may first discuss a complaint with the employee's immediate supervisor and may have his/her Union steward present. It shall be discussed verbally and if settled, no further action shall be taken.

Section 4.
Steps in the Grievance Procedure

Step 1. The aggrieved employee or group of employees must present the grievance to his/her immediate supervisor in writing within seven (7) actual working days of the occurrence of the act or acts about which there is a complaint. The aggrieved employee has the right to have a steward and/or staff representative in attendance at the meeting if he/she so requests. The manager and/or immediate supervisor shall hold a meeting within five (5) actual working days after the grievance is presented to him/her in writing.

The manager/supervisor shall reply to the employee within five (5) actual working days from the termination of the meeting. If an employee does not agree with the response or does not receive a reply to his/her written grievance within five (5) working days, unless the time limits are
mutually waived, his/her grievance may be taken to Step 2 of the grievance procedure. A Step 2 grievance must be filed within five (5) working days after the employee receives his/her reply or should have received his/her reply.

Group grievances, in this Step, shall be presented in the first instance to the lowest ranking supervisor common to all employees in the group. If a group grievance is not satisfactorily settled in this Step, the procedure defined in Step 2 shall be used.

Step 2. An employee or group of employees whose grievance has not been answered under Step 1 of this procedure or has been answered, but not settled under Step 1 of this procedure may refer the grievance to the department head or the designated second step hearing officer within the department, within five (5) working days following receipt of the answer from the first step or five (5) working days from the date the answer should have been received and no answer was filed by the manager/supervisor. The distribution by the employee of the copies of the written grievance shall be as follows: one (1) copy to the manager and/or immediate supervisor, one (1) copy to the department head, one (1) copy to the employee representative, and a fourth copy shall be retained by the employee. The department head or his/her designee will investigate, make inquiries, and hold a hearing on the grievance within five (5) working days of receipt of the grievance. The department head/designee shall reply to the employee within five (5) actual working days from the termination of the meeting. If the employee does not receive a satisfactory reply to his/her written grievance within five (5) working days, or if the employee receives no reply to his/her written grievance at the end of the five (5) working days, his/her grievance may be taken to Step 3 of the grievance procedure within five (5) working days after the date the reply was or should have been received.

Step 3. If a grievance is not settled at Step 2, files relating

to the grievance shall be forwarded to the County * Human Resources Director, or his/her nominee, for the resolution of the grievance. The Union shall forward the grievance and copies of the reply thereto, if any. The County * Human Resources Director, or his/her nominee, shall hold a meeting with regard to the grievance within five (5) working days following receipt of the grievance. The grievance meeting shall include no more than four (4) representatives of the employee (example staff representative and/or steward and/or employee), and no more than four (4) representatives of County Management. Both the employee and the County Management representatives shall have the right to have available such witnesses as are necessary for the explanation and investigation of the grievance. The * Human Resources Director, or his/her nominee, shall reply to the employee in writing within ten (10) actual working days from the termination of the meeting.

Section 5.
Step 4. Arbitration.
A. If the grievance is not settled in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the Union may refer the grievance to binding arbitration by notice in writing to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) requesting a panel of five (5) arbitrators with a copy to the * Human Resources Director, postmarked within ten (10) working days following receipt of the * Human Resources Director's answer in Step 3. Either party may reject one (1) entire panel. Both the County and the Union shall have the right to strike two (2) names from the panel. The party requesting arbitration shall strike the first name, the other party shall then strike a second name, the first party a third name, and other party a fourth name, and the remaining person shall be the arbitrator. Except as otherwise specified by this Agreement, the rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply. All
arbitration hearings shall be held in Dayton, Ohio (unless the parties mutually agree otherwise).

B. Selection of the arbitrator and scheduling of the arbitration hearing shall be completed within forty-five (45) calendar days after the request for the arbitration panel is sent unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. Either party may reject one (1) calendar submitted to the parties by AAA. The parties will schedule cases involving discharge as soon as possible.

C. The arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not legislative capacity and shall have no right to recommend to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. He/she shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue submitted, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue not so submitted to him/her. In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the terms of this Agreement, he/she shall fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall submit in writing his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days following close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to a written extension thereof. The decision shall be based solely upon his/her interpretation of the meaning or application of the express terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented. A decision rendered consistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be final and binding. In cases involving removal for abuse, if the Arbitrator finds that there has been serious abuse of residents at the Country View Manor and Stillwater, the Arbitrator does not have the authority to modify the removal of the employee committing such abuse.

D. The fee and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the County and the Union provided, however, that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and non-employee witnesses.

E. Two or more grievances may not be joined or consolidated for hearing by an arbitrator except upon agreement of both parties.

Effective January 1, 1993, an employee absent from work because of any service connected occupational illness or injury, as determined by the Industrial Commission, shall be entitled to reinstatement at the same rate of pay he/she received prior to the date of such illness or injury, upon approval of his/her application to return to work. Such application shall be made within one (1) year following the date of the injury. This period may be extended with the approval of Management and upon the advice of competent medical authority. Seniority rights will continue to accumulate during such absence.

It is the responsibility of the injured employee to inform Management of the estimated length of his/her absence, as determined by the treating physician. This notification shall be made in a timely manner, and in any event shall not exceed two (2) weeks following said injury. If an estimation of such absence cannot be made by the treating physician, then the employee is required to report to his/her immediate supervisor either by phone or by letter, on a bi-weekly basis until an estimated time of absence can be ascertained.

C. Effective January 1, 1993, if an employee misses work because of a work-related injury, he/she shall receive wage continuation during the twelve (12) weeks immediately following the injury or until he/she is physically able to return to work, whichever is earlier. Wage continuation will only be paid for any time period for which the employee would be eligible for worker's compensation benefits. An injured employee will reimburse the County for any wage continuation payments which are later determined to have been improperly made, for any reason. Payment of wage continuation under this section will be computed on the basis of the employee's base rate of pay. If the employee has not returned to work at the end of the twelve (12) week period, wage continuation will cease and the employee will receive temporary total compensation from the Bureau of Workers' Compensation. The employee may elect to use accrued sick leave in accordance with Montgomery County's sick leave provisions for any time period for which he/she is not currently eligible for wage continuation or workers' compensation benefits.

Additionally, the injured employee may elect to use accrued sick leave after wage continuation ceases. In no event, however, will the employee be permitted to buy back sick leave.

Compensation application form.

E. The County may require an employee to perform other duties within the limitations of the injury during the period of compensable injury.

Section 4.
Management may require a second opinion from a physician of its choosing if leave without pay for medical reasons is requested. Additionally, Management may require an employee to take an examination conducted by a licensed physician of Management's selection to determine an employee's capacity to perform the duties of his/her position. The cost of such examinations shall be paid for by the County.

The employee on long-term military leave will receive the difference between his/her gross monthly wage or salary as a County employee and the sum of his/her gross uniformed pay and allowances received that month, for a period not to exceed three hundred and sixty-five (365) calendar days, including the short-term leave period. Vacation and sick leave hours benefits will not be accrued during a long-term military leave of absence without pay. However, for purposes of retirement and seniority, time in active duty will be accredited to the employee's service record in accordance with Paragraph 5.

5. If an employee has been on long-term military leave of absence and is then separated or discharged under honorable conditions from the service, he/she may, through the Human Resources Director, request reemployment with Montgomery County. This request must be in writing and must be submitted within 90 calendar days of release from active duty. The County will then return him/her to either his/her former position or one of like responsibility with full seniority rights, wage adjustments, step increases or other benefits that would have been due as though he/she had been actively employed at the County.
