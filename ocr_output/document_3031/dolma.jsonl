All probationary employees, including special probationary employees, shall receive an employee evaluation on or near the midpoint of their probationary period.\n\nA.\nEach newly hired employee becomes an initial probationary employee upon the date of their employment and remains so until they have successfully completed their required initial probationary period. The required initial probationary period shall be one hundred twenty (120) days except for professional employees and all Job and Family Services employees and the classifications of Animal Care and Control Officer and Animal Care Provider whose initial probationary period will be one hundred eighty (180) days.\n\nThe initial probationary period required above represents a total cumulative service time, and may be adjusted upward so as to properly allow for any authorized leaves of absence or other approved breaks in service.\n\nDuring the initial probationary period, the probationary employee may be disciplined, discharged, laid off, or otherwise dismissed at the sole discretion of the County and neither the reason for nor the disciplinary action, discharge, lay-off, or dismissal may be subject of a grievance.\n\nIn the case of lay-off, bumping and recall, there shall be no seniority among initial probationary employees. Upon the successful completion of the initial probationary period, however, the employee shall attain regular employee status and receive all benefits normally afforded to regular employees, including seniority. Employees shall acquire seniority credit, and their seniority shall be retroactive to the date of employment, less any adjustments.\n\nB.\nAny regular employee who is voluntarily transferred (other than on a temporary basis), promoted, or given a lateral classification change becomes a\nspecial probationary employee upon the date of the transfer, promotion, or lateral classification change and remains so until they have successfully completed a required special probationary period. These special probationary periods shall be as set forth below:\n\n1. Transferred employees (voluntary): sixty (60) days.\n   (Mandatory transfers do not require probation.)\n\n2. Promoted or lateral classification change employees:\n   a. one hundred twenty (120) days except for professional employees whose probationary period is one hundred eighty (180) days.\n\n   b. All Job and Family Services promotional or lateral classification change probationary periods shall be one hundred eighty (180) days.\n\n   c. The classifications of Animal Care and Control Officer and Animal Care Provider shall have a probationary period of 180 days.\n\nThe special probationary periods required above represent a total cumulative service time, and they may be adjusted upward so as to properly allow for any authorized leaves of absence or other approved breaks in service.\n\nIf the special probationary employee fails to demonstrate that he/she can completely and satisfactorily perform the job within the special probationary period, the County shall return the employee to his/her former position classification, without any loss in seniority. Any other employees who were transferred, promoted or received a lateral classification change following and as a result of this employee's transfer, promotion, or lateral classification change shall also be returned to their former positions, and unless there is a lay-off involved, the bumping procedure shall not apply.\n\nC. It is agreed that all persons in an initial probationary status are excluded from coverage of this Agreement.\n\nSection 6.\nWhen a demotion occurs, job classification seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous service in a classification beginning with the last date of entry into the classification except as stipulated in Section 5, Probation and Probationary Periods.\nARTICLE 9\n\nLAY-OFF AND RECALL\n\nSection 1.\nLay Off/Abolishment\n\nThe County, in its discretion, shall determine whether lay-offs are necessary and within which classifications lay-offs will occur. Although not limited to the following, lay-offs shall ordinarily be for lack of work and/or lack of funds. If the County determines that positions are to be abolished, employees losing their jobs because of such abolishment shall be given the same rights as laid-off employees. The County may not lay-off employees for disciplinary reasons or for arbitrary and capricious reasons.\n\nEmployees will be laid off from the affected classification in accordance to their overall seniority and their present ability to perform the remaining work available without further formal training. When seniority is equal, the employee with the lowest last four digits in his/her social security number will be laid off first. Affected employees will be given ten (10) working days notice of a lay-off.\n\nSection 2.\nDisplacement Rights\n\nAn employee whose position is abolished, who is subject to lay off, or who is displaced as a result of lay off/abolishment shall have the right to fill an available vacancy in the same classification or lower classification within the classification series within the lay off district. If there are no current vacant positions in the classification, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the same classification. If the employee has no right to displace within the classification and there exists lower classifications within a class series, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the next or subsequently lower classifications within the classification series. Retention points shall be based upon seniority only.\n\nSection 3.\nRecall\n\nEmployees who are laid off shall be placed on a recall list for a period of twenty-four (24) months. If there is a recall, employees who are still on the recall list shall be recalled in the inverse order of their lay-off, provided they are presently qualified to perform the work in the job classification to which they are recalled without further training.\n\nIf an employee is recalled to a position in a lower rated job classification, he/she shall have the right to return to the job classification he/she held prior to being laid off in the event it subsequently becomes available. If an employee is recalled to a lower rated job classification, the employee shall have the right to refuse the recall. The County shall not hire new employees in affected bargaining unit positions as long as there are still employees on the recall list who are presently qualified to perform the work in the affected job classification and are willing to be recalled to said classification.\n\nEmployees who are eligible for recall shall be given fourteen (14) calendar days notice of recall and notice of recall shall be sent to the employee by certified or registered mail with a copy to the Union. The employee must notify the Agency Head of his/her intention to return within three (3) days after receiving notice of recall. The County shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations by mailing the recall notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address provided by the employee, it being the obligation and responsibility of the employee to provide the Agency Head with his/her latest mailing address.\n\nSection 4.\nLay Off Districts:\n\nThe County shall be divided into five lay-off districts.\n\n1. Sanitary Engineering Department\n2. Public Works Department\n3. Job and Family Services Department\n4. Stillwater Center and Country View Manor\n5.

A Step 2 grievance must be filed within five (5) working days after the employee receives his/her reply or should have received his/her reply.\n\nGroup grievances, in this Step, shall be presented in the first instance to the lowest ranking supervisor common to all employees in the group. If a group grievance is not satisfactorily settled in this Step, the procedure defined in Step 2 shall be used.\n\nStep 2. An employee or group of employees whose grievance has not been answered under Step 1 of this procedure or has been answered, but not settled under Step 1 of this procedure may refer the grievance to the department head or the designated second step hearing officer within the department, within five (5) working days following receipt of the answer from the first step or five (5) working days from the date the answer should have been received and no answer was filed by the manager/supervisor. The distribution by the employee of the copies of the written grievance shall be as follows: one (1) copy to the manager and/or immediate supervisor, one (1) copy to the department head, one (1) copy to the employee representative, and a fourth copy shall be retained by the employee.

Selection of the arbitrator and scheduling of the arbitration hearing shall be completed within forty-five (45) calendar days after the request for the arbitration panel is sent unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. Either party may reject one (1) calendar submitted to the parties by AAA. The parties will schedule cases involving discharge as soon as possible.\n\nC. The arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not legislative capacity and shall have no right to recommend to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. He/she shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue submitted, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue not so submitted to him/her. In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the terms of this Agreement, he/she shall fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall submit in writing his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days following close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to a written extension thereof. The decision shall be based solely upon his/her interpretation of the meaning or application of the express terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented. A decision rendered consistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be final and binding.
