ARTICLE 9

LAY-OFF AND RECALL

Section 1.
Lay Off/Abolishment

The County, in its discretion, shall determine whether lay-offs are necessary and within which classifications lay-offs will occur. Although not limited to the following, lay-offs shall ordinarily be for lack of work and/or lack of funds. If the County determines that positions are to be abolished, employees losing their jobs because of such abolishment shall be given the same rights as laid-off employees. The County may not lay-off employees for disciplinary reasons or for arbitrary and capricious reasons.

Employees will be laid off from the affected classification in accordance to their overall seniority and their present ability to perform the remaining work available without further formal training. When seniority is equal, the employee with the lowest last four digits in his/her social security number will be laid off first. Affected employees will be given ten (10) working days notice of a lay-off.

Section 2.
Displacement Rights

An employee whose position is abolished, who is subject to lay off, or who is displaced as a result of lay off/abolishment shall have the right to fill an available vacancy in the same classification or lower classification within the classification series within the lay off district. If there are no current vacant positions in the classification, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the same classification. If the employee has no right to displace within the classification and there exists lower classifications within a class series, an employee with more retention points may displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the next or subsequently lower classifications within the classification series. Retention points shall be based upon seniority only.

Section 3.
Recall

Employees who are laid off shall be placed on a recall list for a period of twenty-four (24) months. If there is a recall, employees who are still on the recall list shall be recalled in the inverse order of their lay-off, provided they are presently qualified to perform the work in the job classification to which they are recalled without further training.

If an employee is recalled to a position in a lower rated job classification, he/she shall have the right to return to the job classification he/she held prior to being laid off in the event it subsequently becomes available. If an employee is recalled to a lower rated job classification, the employee shall have the right to refuse the recall. The County shall not hire new employees in affected bargaining unit positions as long as there are still employees on the recall list who are presently qualified to perform the work in the affected job classification and are willing to be recalled to said classification.

Employees who are eligible for recall shall be given fourteen (14) calendar days notice of recall and notice of recall shall be sent to the employee by certified or registered mail with a copy to the Union. The employee must notify the Agency Head of his/her intention to return within three (3) days after receiving notice of recall. The County shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations by mailing the recall notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address provided by the employee, it being the obligation and responsibility of the employee to provide the Agency Head with his/her latest mailing address.
