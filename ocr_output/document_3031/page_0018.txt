arbitration hearings shall be held in Dayton, Ohio (unless the parties mutually agree otherwise).

B. Selection of the arbitrator and scheduling of the arbitration hearing shall be completed within forty-five (45) calendar days after the request for the arbitration panel is sent unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. Either party may reject one (1) calendar submitted to the parties by AAA. The parties will schedule cases involving discharge as soon as possible.

C. The arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not legislative capacity and shall have no right to recommend to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. He/she shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue submitted, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue not so submitted to him/her. In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the terms of this Agreement, he/she shall fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall submit in writing his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days following close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to a written extension thereof. The decision shall be based solely upon his/her interpretation of the meaning or application of the express terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented. A decision rendered consistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be final and binding. In cases involving removal for abuse, if the Arbitrator finds that there has been serious abuse of residents at the Country View Manor and Stillwater, the Arbitrator does not have the authority to modify the removal of the employee committing such abuse.

D. The fee and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the County and the Union provided, however, that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and non-employee witnesses.

E. Two or more grievances may not be joined or consolidated for hearing by an arbitrator except upon agreement of both parties.

Section 6.
