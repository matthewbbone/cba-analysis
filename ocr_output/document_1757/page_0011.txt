D. It is agreed that the Pension Plan adopted by the Trustees of the Pension Fund shall be such as will qualify for approval by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States Treasury Department, so as to enable the Employer to treat contributions to the Pension Fund as a deduction for income tax purposes.

E. Contributions provided for herein shall be paid monthly and shall be accompanied by a completed remittance report. Both payment and report are due on the tenth day of the month following the month covered by the report. In the event the Employer fails promptly to pay amounts owed, the Employer shall pay such collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, as the Pension Fund shall incur, and shall pay interest at such rate as the Trustees shall fix from time to time.

F. The payments so made to the Pension Fund shall be used by it to provide retirement benefits for eligible employees in accordance with the Pension Plan of said Fund, as determined by the Trustees of said Fund, to be applied to the eligible employees based on the amount of Employer contribution.

G. This clause encompasses the sole and total agreement between the Employer and the Union with respect to pensions or retirement. If any other agreement between the Employer and the Union (including the Collective Bargaining Agreement) contains provisions inconsistent with this clause,
