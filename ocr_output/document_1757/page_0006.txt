In the event of multiple bids posted at one time, employees bidding multiple times must number such bids as to their preference, and the Company will award such bids by the employee's preference. The senior bidder will be awarded the job as outlined in this section.

Section 5    An employee who successfully bids for a job shall not be able to bid for another job for twelve (12) months. If an employee is awarded a vacancy and does not accept the vacancy, the bid shall be considered a successful bid. A bump shall not be considered as a bid.

Section 6    In the event it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees for lack of work, the Company agrees to give employees to be laid off either three (3) days' notice or three (3) days' pay in lieu thereof. Lay-offs shall be in the order of seniority and the last one employed shall be the first laid-off. Prior to any full-time employees being laid-off pursuant to this section, the necessary amount of probationary employees shall be laid off. If more lay-offs are needed lay-offs shall be accomplished by counting up from the bottom of the seniority list the number of employees not needed because of lack of work. Employees remaining but who are without an assignment because there position has been reduced because of lack of work shall be allowed to bump within their department provided their seniority is greater than the employee being bumped. This process will continue for those who do not have assignments or who have been bumped starting with their department and then their shift and then plant wide.

    Employees on lay off will be recalled by order of seniority and shall be returned to their position and shift, if not available, department and shift; if not available, shift or if not available, plant, in that order, seniority permitting. If an employee on lay off cannot be reached by telephone for recall, he/she will be notified of recall by registered mail (returned receipt requested) at his/her last known address.

    An employee will keep the Company informed of such employee's current telephone number, email, and mailing address.

    In the matter of lay-offs due to reduction in force it is agreed that employees shall continue to accumulate seniority for recall purposes up to twelve (12) months after being laid off.
