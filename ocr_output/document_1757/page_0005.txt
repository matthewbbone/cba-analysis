When a vacancy or a job is newly created on a shift, the Company will post the job for five (5) calendar days and will then have fourteen (14) calendar days to fill the vacancy/new job.

If he/she cannot perform the job satisfactorily, they will be returned to their former job without loss of seniority and the next bidder shall be given a trial. Once awarded, the following vacancy will be posted and awarded as outlined above. Any subsequent opening will be filled by the Company.

Employees shall be permitted to bid on job openings while they are absent as long as they notify the Company in writing via letter or email during the posting period of their interest in the job opening.

It is understood that the Company will post an interest bid for Lead and Star Point positions. Movement into these positions will be by appointment by the Company. The Company may rotate Star Point positions on an eighteen (18) month basis and employees leaving the Star Point position shall return to an open position. Leads may be placed on a different shift, within the same department, for training or shift coverage not to exceed one (1) month (three (3) months for buns) in a twelve (12) month period.
