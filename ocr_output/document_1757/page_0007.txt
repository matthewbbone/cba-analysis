Section 3    The vacation year shall be January 1st to December 31st. The scheduling process for vacations will commence sometime in November for the upcoming year. Vacation selection shall begin with the most senior eligible employee selecting their first week to the least senior eligible employee selecting. This shall then be repeated from most senior eligible to least senior eligible until all weeks are scheduled. Vacations will be scheduled and taken in full week increments, except as listed in Section 5 of this Article. The Company reserves the right to establish the number of vacations that may be scheduled each week by department, team and by shift in order to continue effective operations. Vacations cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next, therefore all vacation weeks must be scheduled and taken by the end of each calendar year.

Section 4    Vacation pay shall be the equivalent of forty (40) hours, based on the straight-time rate of pay the employee is earning at the time of his/her vacation. With the exception of one (1) week, paid vacation shall run concurrent when an employee takes leave for a family member covered under the Family Medical Leave Act. Employees will select the vacation week he/she retains.
