SENIORITY

Section 1 Seniority shall be determined by the length of service and shall be applied in the case of vacation selection and layoff/recall within the employee's department.

If two (2) or more employees start on the same day employees' seniority shall be determined by last name, then first name and then middle name, at the time of hire.
Section 2    In order to determine the ability of any new employees, the Company shall be granted a probationary period of three (3) months for all new employees. This probationary period may be extended for an additional three (3) months upon mutual agreement by the Company and the Union should an employee not be meeting expectations so that an improvement plan can be discussed with the employee and Union to enable the employee to demonstrate the necessary competencies. During the probationary period the Company may discharge the newly-hired employee if he or she is found to be unsuitable, without recourse to the grievance procedure. After the probationary period, the employee takes on the status of a permanent employee and shall not be discharged except for cause.

a. Quits or retires;
b. Is discharged for just cause;

f. Is off work for twelve (12) months due to a work related injury, non-work related injury or illness.

Section 4

When a vacancy or a job is newly created on a shift, the Company will post the job for five (5) calendar days and will then have fourteen (14) calendar days to fill the vacancy/new job. The bid will include a description of the position, shift and regular hours of work. Within this fourteen (14) day time period the Company shall post a notice identifying the successful bidder. The Company will determine the successful bidder from those bidders who are capable of performing the work by seniority. An employee will have five (5) working days to disqualify himself/herself, the Company will have fifteen (15) working days to disqualify an employee. If he/she cannot perform the job satisfactorily, they will be returned to their former job without loss of seniority and the next bidder shall be given a trial. Once awarded, the following vacancy will be posted and awarded as outlined above. Any subsequent opening will be filled by the Company.

Employees shall be permitted to bid on job openings while they are absent as long as they notify the Company in writing via letter or email during the posting period of their interest in the job opening.

It is understood that the Company will post an interest bid for Lead and Star Point positions. Movement into these positions will be by appointment by the Company. The Company may rotate Star Point positions on an eighteen (18) month basis and employees leaving the Star Point position shall return to an open position. Leads may be placed on a different shift, within the same department, for training or shift coverage not to exceed one (1) month (three (3) months for buns) in a twelve (12) month period.
In the event of multiple bids posted at one time, employees bidding multiple times must number such bids as to their preference, and the Company will award such bids by the employee's preference. The senior bidder will be awarded the job as outlined in this section.

Section 5    An employee who successfully bids for a job shall not be able to bid for another job for twelve (12) months. If an employee is awarded a vacancy and does not accept the vacancy, the bid shall be considered a successful bid. A bump shall not be considered as a bid.

Section 6    In the event it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees for lack of work, the Company agrees to give employees to be laid off either three (3) days' notice or three (3) days' pay in lieu thereof. Lay-offs shall be in the order of seniority and the last one employed shall be the first laid-off. Prior to any full-time employees being laid-off pursuant to this section, the necessary amount of probationary employees shall be laid off. If more lay-offs are needed lay-offs shall be accomplished by counting up from the bottom of the seniority list the number of employees not needed because of lack of work. Employees remaining but who are without an assignment because there position has been reduced because of lack of work shall be allowed to bump within their department provided their seniority is greater than the employee being bumped. This process will continue for those who do not have assignments or who have been bumped starting with their department and then their shift and then plant wide.

    Employees on lay off will be recalled by order of seniority and shall be returned to their position and shift, if not available, department and shift; if not available, shift or if not available, plant, in that order, seniority permitting. If an employee on lay off cannot be reached by telephone for recall, he/she will be notified of recall by registered mail (returned receipt requested) at his/her last known address.

    An employee will keep the Company informed of such employee's current telephone number, email, and mailing address.

    In the matter of lay-offs due to reduction in force it is agreed that employees shall continue to accumulate seniority for recall purposes up to twelve (12) months after being laid off.
