Section 4    An employee shall be compensated at time and one half (1 \( \frac{1}{2} \)) the hourly rate for all hours worked between 12:01 am and midnight on the holiday.

Section 5    To qualify for holiday pay, the employee must be on the schedule for the holiday week, work the last scheduled day before the holiday, the holiday if scheduled, and the first scheduled day after the holiday. Employees on vacation during a week in which a holiday falls shall receive holiday pay equal to the amount of hours the employee normally works times his current rate of pay in addition to vacation pay.

Section 6    In addition, employees with one (1) full year of service shall be entitled to three (3) floating holidays per year. Employees shall receive the equivalent of their normally scheduled workday based on the straight-time wage rate the employee is earning at the time for the floating holiday. Floating holidays will be requested by employees with at least one (1) week notice provided, except in case of emergency approved by management, and will be scheduled upon mutual agreement, which will not be unreasonably withheld by the Company. One (1) floating holiday per calendar year may be used as an emergency floating holiday that does not need one (1) week notice. Floating holiday request form with the day marked "emergency floating holiday" must be submitted next working day or an attendance point will be given. These holidays must be used during the calendar year and will not be carried over into the following calendar year. All work performed by an employee in excess of thirty-two (32) hours in a week in which an employee has a floating holiday shall be paid at time and one half (1 \( \frac{1}{2} \)) the employee's straight time rate of pay.
