APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM

Foreword
The purpose of apprenticeship training is to encourage a more careful selection of personnel coming into the trade, to train apprentices now in the trade, to provide training that will equip this employee for profitable employment and good citizenship, and to insure the employer the best possible workmen and the public the best possible workmanship.
• Highly-skilled craftsmen must be capable of exercising independent judgment, understand the theory underlying the work they are called upon to do and the properties of the materials used, know the laws and regulations applicable to their work, and be capable of advancing, in time, to positions requiring leadership and responsibility.
This program has as its broad purpose the establishment and maintenance of high standards of workmanship through the development of highly skilled craftsmen by definite standards of on-the job training, supplemented by the required amount of related technical and theoretical training and instruction.
