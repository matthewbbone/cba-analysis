Thereafter, upon request of the Union the Company will negotiate as to the conditions affecting any employees desiring the opportunity to transfer to the new location and as to the conditions relating to employees affected by permanent lay-off including severance pay.\n\nARTICLE V\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\n8. A complaint arising over wages, hours, or working conditions between the Company and the Union as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this agreement, shall be settled as promptly as possible in accordance with the following procedure.\n9.

Upon receiving an employee's request to see the Steward, the Supervisor shall bring the Steward promptly.\n9.2 The employee and Steward shall have ample time and opportunity for private discussion.\n9.3 The employee, the Supervisor, and the Steward shall discuss the complaint for the purpose of settling the specified complaint as promptly as possible, if the complaint cannot be thus adjusted then\n\nSTEP 1 \u2013 By the Chief Steward and the Manager or the appropriate divisional representative of the plant in which the grievance arose, and if not satisfactorily adjusted then, and only then, can a written grievance be submitted by the Steward and/or Chief Steward in accordance with this Article. The Union shall submit the grievance in writing to the Manager or the designated representative of the Company and shall state the Paragraph of the Agreement for which the violation is claimed. The grievance shall be processed as provided herein and shall be presented within ten (10) working days of the alleged violation. The Manager or the designated representative of the Company must give its written decision within two (2) working days. The grievance will be settled in favor of the employee if the Company fails to give its written decision within two (2) working days. The grievance shall be considered cancelled unless the Union notifies the Company in writing within five (5) working days that it is being placed in the 2nd step. Such notification may be made on a form provided by the Company, and a duplicate retained by the Union; but in any event, a grievance shall not be discussed\nat the next-scheduled 2nd step meeting unless presented to the 2nd step at least twenty-four hours prior to such meeting.\n\nSTEP 2 \u2013 By the Union Grievance Committee and other designated representatives of the Union, and a representative or representatives of the Management at regularly scheduled weekly or specially called meetings.

The grievance shall be considered cancelled unless the Union notifies the Company in writing within ten (10) working days of its intention to panel the grievance for arbitration as provided herein. When an extension of the time limits would contribute to the proper settlement of any grievance, the parties may mutually agree, in writing, to grant such extension. Grievances may be amended in any Step except as limited in paragraph 19. If the grievances are not satisfactorily adjusted, then\n\nSTEP 3 \u2013 The grievance shall be referred to an Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Article.\n\n10.

However, any income earned by an employee from other normal and regular employment will not be deducted from any retroactive settlement, provided such employment commenced prior to the disciplinary action.\n\n10.1 If a grievance is not presented within the applicable time limit, it shall be barred.\n\n11. Before a Steward leaves his or her job or his or her department to handle a complaint or grievance, he or she shall\nobtain permission from his or her Supervisor. Should he or she go into another department, he or she shall report to the Supervisor of that department. In the event an employee is called in by either party to participate in the settlement of an individual employee's complaint or grievance, such employee shall be paid for time so spent at their regular day work rate. These provisions shall apply only to the processing of the grievance by the Manager or the appropriate divisional representative and shall not apply to grievances involving groups of employees.\n\n12. The Company and the Union shall exchange current lists of their designated representatives for the handling of complaints and/or grievances.\n\nArbitration Procedure\n\n13. The Union and Company shall select a new outside arbitrator for each arbitration panel as follows:\n  13.1 The Union and the Company shall select an Arbitrator for the purpose of deciding disputes and grievances that arise between the Union and Company.

The last remaining name will be the Arbitrator.\n  13.3 The selection of an Arbitrator shall commence no later than thirty (30) days after signing of this Agreement.\n\n14. In the submission to arbitration of grievances arising over wages, hours, and working conditions, as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this agreement, each Arbitrator hearing such grievances shall be limited to the hearing of not more than six (6) non-discharge grievances nor more than four (4) discharge grievances.\n15. The Arbitrator shall preside over only one arbitration hearing. Should either party find it necessary to terminate the services of the Arbitrator prior to completion of the arbitration hearing, it may do so by serving the Arbitrator and the other party with written notice. The remaining grievances on the panel, if any, may be scheduled at later Arbitration hearings.\n\n16. Each party shall pay one-half of the expense of the Arbitrator, and other expenses incurred in connection with such arbitration proceedings.\n\n17. The Union will give notification to the Company of the number of each grievance and the name of each grievant of those grievances to be assigned to a panel.

However an employee moving into a new division on voluntary transfer (34.2 & 34.3) may bid on a job in the new division providing the effective date is beyond the five (5) day period in which they establish residence.\n    22.2.1 Other than resident recalls, in the event a younger seniority employee arrives in the seniority division by reason of voluntary transfer or recall from layoff prior to a senior employee transferring in, the five (5) days will be waived and the senior employee will establish immediate\ntemporary resident seniority for bidding purposes.\n\n22.3 If the employee is subject to lay-off during such period (prior to attaining residence in the seniority division in which he or she is working) the employee's regular company seniority will become effective in that division for the purpose of assignment due to the lay-off only. He or she shall be subject to all other lay-offs provisions of this Agreement.\n\n22.4 An employee with one or more years seniority who is laid off from his or her resident seniority division shall continue to maintain rights in the division for six (6) months from the date of lay-off from that division.\n\n22.5 If an employee with one or more years seniority is placed in another seniority division in accordance with Paragraph 38 or sub-paragraph 34.6 he or she shall automatically establish temporary residence in that division for six (6) months after which they shall establish regular residence, except for the provisions of sub-paragraph 22.6.\n\n22.6 An employee during such temporary residence must file written notice with the Industrial Relations Department stating that he or she does not desire to hold their resident seniority for the six (6) months allowable period as above in sub-paragraph 22.4. A copy of such notice will be retained by the employee.\n\n22.7 An employee with less than one year of seniority who is placed in a seniority division shall automatically establish temporary residence for the purpose of the provisions of Paragraph 29.\n\n23.

Within thirty (30) days after the signing of this Agreement, the Company will compile and post in the plant a master seniority list showing the seniority divisions in that plant and the name and length of service with the Company of each employee within each such seniority division. Such lists shall remain posted, and the Company will replace each list with a new and complete, up-to-date list once each thirty (30) days, if possible, and not less than once each sixty (60) days, excepting, however, that in the event a major lay-off occurs, the Company will at the time of lay-off post a new list in the plant where such lay-off occurs. The Company will furnish the Union with a master seniority list of all employees in all seniority divisions of the Company.\n\n25. Upon the request of the District Steward, the Supervisor will furnish such Steward with the seniority status of any employee transferred or hired into that district or division.\n\n26. Employees with the greatest amount of seniority shall be given preference as to the shift they shall work on their job classification within their seniority division.\n    26.1 In exercising shift preference, the employee will displace the youngest employee in their job classification within their seniority division, excluding employees that have signed jobs in a different classification effective at the same time as the shift\npreference. At this time the senior employee will bump the next junior employee possible.\n26.1.1 In the event the employee does not have the physical qualifications to displace the youngest employee he or she shall displace the youngest employee possible.\n26.1.2 In being transferred under the provisions of this paragraph, training time will be allowed. The employee shall be given until the end of the shift to demonstrate an ability to perform the job without assistance, provided satisfactory progress is being made.\n26.1.3 Employees who are being bumped in job ranks six (6) through the provisions of this paragraph will be given a reasonable time to demonstrate their qualifications providing they are making satisfactory progress.\n26.2 An employee may exercise such shift preference right four (4) times within a calendar year.\n26.3 A shift preference move shall be effective no later than the second Monday following the employee's notification; provided however, the notification is made no later than the end of the employee's working shift on Wednesday of any given week. All shift preference moves will be made on Monday.\n26.4 The Chief Steward and the District Stewards shall not be subject to the provisions of this paragraph.\n26.5 In order to maintain efficiency and production a temporary move may be made by the Company, regardless of shift, not to exceed three weeks in any one year, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement of the parties. In the event the Company temporarily transfers an employee for reasons of efficiency he or she shall not suffer loss of earnings for overtime or shift premium because of the temporary transfer.\n\n27. Seniority shall be the deciding factor in determining all situations between two or more employees pertaining to but not covered by this Agreement.\n    27.1 Among the employees with the same seniority date, the employee with the lowest clock number shall be considered senior, providing that an employee shall not bump an employee with the same seniority date.\n\n28. Seniority divisions, as agreed to by the parties, are attached hereto as an addendum. Revisions of the seniority divisions may be made by mutual agreement of the parties as changes or conditions warrant.\n\nARTICLE VII\nBID PROCEDURE\n\n29. In the event of any major manpower movement of 35 people or more, the Company will have the right to freeze all manpower placement (as could occur under any contractual manpower movement provision) for no more than five (5) working days in order to complete the move. Any employee affected by this freezing of manpower will be held as excess and placed on the Monday after the move is complete. The supervisor, in making transfers or promotions to available jobs in a seniority division, will give preference to qualified employees having residence in the seniority division where the vacancy exists. Such vacancies shall be listed for bids by\nemployees in that seniority division and such bids will remain listed for a period not less than 24 consecutive work hours.\n\n29.1 Available job shall mean: a quit, discharge, leave-of-absence, voluntary transfer, military service, death of employee, retiree or an increase in the total manpower of the seniority division and/or an increase in the total manpower of any classification. If an employee on leave of absence or military service never returns to the job the Company has no obligation to re-bid the job he/she vacated.\n\n29.1.1 Available jobs will be bid down to entry-level jobs one time. Afterwards, any resulting vacancy will be filled by Paragraph 29.9 and 34.\n\n29.2 Bids will be accepted only from employees in the seniority division where the vacancy exists. There will be no limit on the number of bids to jobs paying higher day work rate except\n\n29.3 An employee will be limited to four (4) bids within a calendar year to jobs paying the same or lower day work rate and may not bid again to a higher day work rate for a period of ten (10) days.\n\n29.4 From among such qualified bids the employee who has the necessary qualifications and who has the greatest seniority will be given the job. A reasonable training period will be allowed.\n\n29.4.1 An employee who signs a listing of multiple jobs within the same job classification may indicate the specific job he or she is bidding for and will not be considered for any other job within that classification on that listing.\n\n29.4.2 Employees who qualify for two or more available jobs at the same time may have their choice of the jobs.\n\n29.5 Bidding stations will be designated for each seniority division and the listing of vacancies shall include the job classification, job station, department and area, rate of pay, shift, effective date and time and date of listing.\n29.6 The Supervisor will advise the Steward of the successful bidder in writing within two (2) working days after the effective date.\n\n29.7 Available jobs will be filled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph before employees with less seniority are placed on available jobs in accordance with Paragraph 37 and 38.\n\n29.8 If there are no bids filed or qualified bidders on upgrade jobs, such vacancies shall be filled by the junior entry-level employee in the division. If there are no qualified bidders in the entry level job such vacancy shall be filled by the junior excess entry level employee in the division, except jobs being filled under Paragraph 34.\n\n29.8.1 If a job is not posted for bid, that vacancy will be offered by seniority to excess employees in that specific job classification on that shift, before the junior excess entry level employee in the division is assigned. In Division 12 the job will be offered by seniority to the excess employees in the supervisor's area of responsibility, before the junior excess entry level employee in the division is assigned, except jobs being filled under paragraph 34.\n\n29.9 The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if there are unassigned or excess employees in the specific job classification.\n\n30. An employee who is promoted or transferred to an available job in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29 and after a reasonable training period fails to satisfactorily perform the requirements of the job will be removed from that job and reassigned, seniority permitting, to the job classification from which he or she was transferred or promoted. In the event he or she does not have seniority to be reassigned in this\nclassification he or she will be placed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.\n\n30.1 In the event the employee is removed before the end of his or her third (3rd) day on the job, he or she will be placed back on the job he or she vacated.\n\n31. Temporary promotions shall be limited to five (5) working days each and will be offered by seniority to employees capable of doing the job without training time. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will be filled first from the supervisor's area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event a senior employee is bypassed for lack of qualifications, he or she will be notified in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n31.1 In the event no capable employee accepts the temporary promotion, such promotion will be offered by seniority to all division employees. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will first be offered by seniority to employees in the supervisors area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event no employee accepts the temporary promotion then the least senior entry-level employee among those capable will be assigned to the job.\n\n31.2 A temporary promotion for over five (5) working days each will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29.\n\n31.3 The time limits of this paragraph shall not apply to temporary assignment or promotions for replacements for vacations or military service of less than one month. In these cases the employee who is promoted or assigned shall be considered for the entire term of the\nvacancy including overtime. Employees shall not be exempt from movement under Paragraph 26, 29.1, 31, 34, 34.1, 37 or 38.\n\n31.4 The Supervisor will notify the Steward of temporary promotions on the day they are made.\n\n31.5 Employees temporarily promoted during the course of a shift shall be paid the higher rate for the entire shift.\n\n32. If an employee with seniority in the bargaining unit is promoted to a factory-related salaried position in the Evansville Division and is thereafter transferred back into the bargaining unit, he or she shall accumulate seniority while working in the factory-related salaried position. When so transferred he or she shall commence work as an hourly-rated employee in line with his or her then seniority ranking and in accordance with Paragraph 37 excluding Paragraph 40.1. All present Supervisors and others holding Supervisory positions who were promoted from factory operations are acknowledged to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph.\n\n33. There will be no discrimination in making job assignments.\n\nARTICLE VIII\nTRANSFERS, PROMOTIONS & REHIRES\n\n34. Job vacancies in any seniority division, after fulfilling the requirements of Paragraph 29 shall be filled using the following sequence, provided the employees have the qualifications to do the available work; excepting; however, the stipulation of Paragraph 62.\n\n34.1 Employees maintaining resident seniority rights in that division, provided that an employee in lay-off status who has greater Company seniority shall be recalled before an employee of lesser Company seniority exercises resident seniority rights.\n34.2 A transfer list established in the Industrial Relations Department will consist of the names of employees who have one or more years seniority and have submitted a request in writing to be considered when the vacancy occurs in a specific seniority division, provided that the request has been received in the Industrial Relations Department during the immediate three (3) months preceding the date the vacancy occurs. A copy of such notice will be retained by the employee.\n\n34.3 From among those employees whose request for transfer has been received in the Industrial Relations Department prior to originating a specific move, the most senior employee, allowing a reasonable training period, will be given the job.\n\n34.4 In filling a vacancy by sub-paragraph 34.2 not more than three (3) employees will be moved from the transfer list in filling a specific vacancy.\n\n34.5 Replacements for employees filling vacancies in a specific seniority division will be filled in the following sequence:\n    34.5.1 Sub-paragraph 34.1\n    34.5.2 Sub-paragraph 34.6\n    34.5.3 Sub-paragraph 34.7\n\n34.6 Rehire employees maintaining seniority rights with the Company.\n\n34.7 Hire new employees.\n\n35. An employee shall be limited to two (2) voluntary transfers in any six (6) month period, exclusive of skilled trades, who may not transfer to any other skilled trades division. All other transfers for skilled trades will be honored.\n    35.1 An employee may not have more than two (2) transfers in at any one time. Should more than\none transfer be available at the same time, the first transfer processed by the Employment Office shall void the remaining transfer.\n\n36. An employee laid off from the Company who desires to be exempt from exercising Company seniority as provided in this Article must within thirty (30) days from date of lay-off notify the Company Employment Office in writing that he or she desires the exemption. Such an employee shall be subject to recall only according to resident seniority and subject to all other provisions of Articles VI and IX.\n\n36.1 If an employee's resident division is permanently eliminated during their layoff under Paragraph 36 or their 6 months resident recall rights are exhausted, they will be returned to work under Article IX.\n\nARTICLE IX\nLAYOFF\n\n37. When a lay-off (other than temporary) occurs in any given seniority division, an employee affected will, in exercising his or her divisional seniority, fill a vacant job in his or her classification and if not so placed, then\n\n37.1 Displace the junior employee in his or her job classification, seniority permitting, or will be assigned to another classification in his or her division; filling a vacant job in such classification; and if not so placed will displace an employee with less seniority in such rate of pay; provided, however, that he or she has the necessary qualifications to do the work.\n\n37.2 In so doing, he or she shall displace an employee with the shortest seniority possible to allow him or her to exercise this privilege, normally displacing the employee with the least seniority in the job classification.\n37.3 An employee thus displaced by a senior employee will be adjusted by the provisions of subparagraph 37.1 or 37.2. In being transferred under this provision, no training time will be allowed, however, an employee assigned under the provisions of this paragraph shall be properly instructed and oriented in the job requirements.\n\n37.4 An employee thus assigned will be given up to a maximum of three (3) days to display their qualifications. In no event will an employee be removed because of qualifications as long as he or she is making satisfactory progress.\n\n38. An employee who has exhausted divisional seniority will temporarily acquire Company-wide seniority status. On or before the eighth working day next following such acquisition of temporary Company-wide seniority status, an employee thus affected will be assigned to another job classification in the Company and:\n\n38.1 Displace an employee with less seniority in such classification, provided, however, that he or she has the necessary qualifications to do the work. In so doing, he or she shall displace an employee with the shortest seniority possible to allow them to exercise this privilege, normally displacing the employee with the least seniority in the job classification.\n\n38.2 An employee who has acquired seniority at the time of lay-off and is thus displaced by a senior employee will be adjusted by the procedure outlined in Paragraphs 37 and 38.\n\n38.3 In being transferred under the provisions of Paragraph 38 no training time will be allowed, however, an employee assigned under the\nprovisions of this paragraph shall be properly instructed and oriented in the job requirements. Employees transferred under the provisions of paragraph 38 may bid available jobs immediately upon arriving in the new division.\n\n38.4 An employee thus assigned will be given up to a maximum of three (3) days to display their qualifications. In no event will an employee be removed because of qualifications as long as he or she is making satisfactory progress.\n\n38.5 In being transferred under the provisions of Paragraph 38, an employee may designate those job classifications that he or she wishes to be exempted from. This list will consist of the individual classifications submitted in writing to the Employment Office that the employee desires not to be transferred to, and must be received by the Employment Office prior to originating a specific move to be considered.\n\n39. An employee who has acquired seniority but who has not been placed on a job under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 will be subject to recall under the provisions of Sub-Paragraph 34.6.\n\n40. Transfer of an employee under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 shall be made to a job carrying a rate of pay as near that of their former job as seniority permits.\n\n40.1 An employee may be transferred to a higher job classification under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 provided he or she has previously performed such higher-rated job classification for a sufficient length of time so that no training time would be required, excepting however, under the provisions of\nParagraph 37 the employee must make a request to his or her Supervisor that he or she wishes to be transferred to such higher-rated job classification. An employee displaced by the provisions of this paragraph shall be placed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.\n\n41. When a lay-off (other than temporary) occurs, an employee who because of the provisions of this Article must be assigned to a lower job classification shall notify the Company in writing as to the minimum job rate that he or she will accept in preference to being laid off. An employee may exercise the provisions of this paragraph only when there would be a $.15 or two-labor grade reduction in his or her hourly day work rate.\n\n41.1 An employee affected by the lay-off or rehiring provisions of this Article who declines any job classification properly offered under the provisions of this Agreement, shall not be again considered for a job other than his or regular job classification for a period of ninety (90) days.\n\n41.2 An employee who later desires to change such notice to the Company (during the 90 days) must make application to the Employment Office. At the conclusion of ninety (90) days the employee will be reassigned consistent with his or her written application in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 37.\n\n41.3 Any such employee who refuses a job classification paying the same rate as his or her regular job classification shall be considered as having voluntarily quit.\n\nPhysical Restriction or Physical Lay-Off\n42. The provisions of Paragraph 41 shall not apply where the employee's physical condition (including workers\ncompensation restrictions and the use of prescription drugs that prohibit the operation of motor vehicles and/or heavy equipment) prohibits performance of such a job classification. Such an employee shall be relieved of his or her job assignment always replacing the least senior employee possible on a job excluding excess in the following manner:\n\n42.1 The employee will be assigned, seniority permitting, within his or her job classification, by shift, by seniority division, providing the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.\n\n42.2 The employee will be assigned, seniority permitting, within his or her job classification by seniority division, providing the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.\n\n42.3 The employee will be assigned to the next lower rated job classification in his or her seniority division where the least senior employee is assigned and be placed on a job assignment within that classification, provided the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.\n\n42.4 When an employee (excluding workers compensation cases) has exhausted his or her seniority rights under paragraph 37 because of physical conditions, he or she will be laid off. Until such time as the physical restrictions have been lifted (or for a maximum of five years), the employee will remain on physical layoff and the Company will conduct a job search plant wide only after an initial 6 week period and subsequently at the beginning of each month at which time the employee will be subject to recall under paragraph 38 (excluding paragraph 40 and 40.1 rights) and\nwill displace the least senior employee working in line with his or her physical restrictions, provided the recalled employee can safely perform the job for at least one full working day without assistance. All other contractual rights and benefits will be renewed after the employee has successfully performed the job for at least one full working day. In the case of overlooked jobs, back pay will be limited to the time of the most recent plant wide search. The employee will be eligible for subsequent promotion to any job vacancy provided the job is within his or her restrictions or if the doctor revises the restriction the employee will be returned to work under Paragraph 37 excluding Paragraph 40.1.\n\n42.4.1 Plant wide job searches to place people with workers compensation restrictions will be conducted immediately upon receipt of such restrictions until the employee is placed or the restrictions are lifted.\n\n42.5 It is the employee's responsibility to determine from his/her physician whether a prescribed drug may impair his/her job performance or involve hazardous conditions. Should the physical impairment causing the employee's inability to perform a given job assignment be eliminated, a doctor's statement presented by the employee to that effect, and substantiation be given by the Company doctor to that effect, the employee will be considered for any assignment from which he or she was previously demoted due to physical reasons.\n\n42.6 In cases of disagreement between the employee's doctor and the Company doctor, a\nthird doctor may be called in to make an independent examination and determining judgment and the expenses will be shared equally by the Company and the employee. The third doctor shall be selected by the two doctors first mentioned and shall be a specialist with special training pertinent to the case under consideration.\n\n42.7 The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if the physical restriction is for less than eleven (11) working days. Such employee shall be returned to their regular job assignment. The provisions of the paragraph will not apply when work-related physical restrictions, issued by the company doctor, recommend temporary job placement performing a \"restricted work position\". This type of assignment would typically occur following an on the job injury or illness, when the employee is unable to safely return to his/her regular position, and in order to prevent the employee from going on Workers Compensation leave. This type of \"light duty\" assignment may only be made under company doctor's orders and when the work can be safely performed by the employee and to help prevent further injury. An employee may only be placed in a \"restricted work position\" for a maximum of three (3) weeks, at which time he or she would either return to his or her normal position or be placed in accordance with paragraph 42.4. These light duty positions are not considered \"jobs\" as defined in other paragraphs of this labor agreement.\n43. A lay-off of seven (7) or less working days shall be considered temporary and during such time, work shall be assigned, exclusive of Skilled Trades, to the employee who regularly performs the particular operation on which work is required.\n\n43.1 If more than one employee is employed in performing identical affected operations the employee having the most seniority shall be given first chance to work.\n43.2 On or before the eighth working day, the Company will rearrange the working force to comply with the lay-off provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.\n43.3 An employee who is performing the particular operation, on which work is required during the temporary lay-off, will remain so employed until an employee who is scheduled to replace him or her under Paragraphs 37 and 38 reports for work.\n43.4 It is understood that the time element of Paragraphs 38 and 43 of the lay-off provisions will run concurrently.\n\n44. A cessation of work for less than 24 hours shall not be considered a lay-off. Any cessation of work longer than 24 hours will be considered a temporary lay-off and the affected employee may be up for a new job assignment.\nNotification of Lay-Off\n45. Lay-offs other than temporary:\n45.1 Three (3) working days prior to such a lay-off, the Union will be notified as to the approximate number of employees to be laid off and other conditions pertaining to the lay-off, provided there are twenty-five (25) or more persons being laid off. Employees shall be notified at least twenty-four (24) hours previous to their being laid off; and, at the\nsame time, the District Steward shall be given a complete list of the names of employees to be laid off in his or her district and division.\n\n46. Temporary lay-offs:\n    46.1 The Union and the affected employees will be promptly notified of such lay-offs.\n    46.2 Verification of the extent of the temporary lay-off will be supplied to the Union in writing within 24 hours.\n\n47. Employees may be loaned from one seniority division to another on a daily basis in order to cover for people absent for any reason (except for weekly vacations) and to relieve bottlenecks. Any employee who is \"loaned out\" from his or her regular seniority division shall be the least senior excess or unassigned at the time \"loan out\" occurs. A person can be loaned out of his or her division three times in a day after returning to his/her division for the third time. If a person needs to be loaned out again, the employee will have the option of being loaned out or the employee will be allowed to go home.\n\nDischarges and Disciplinary Lay-Offs\n\n48. Upon the discharge or disciplinary lay-off of any employee, the District Steward or Chief Steward will be notified in the presence of the employee, unless they are not at work at the time of the action.\n    48.1 In the event an employee receives a disciplinary suspension a meeting will be held within two (2) days to determine the facts for final adjudication.\n    48.2 The time limit may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.\n    48.3 If such action were proven improper and unjustified, the employee will be reinstated with seniority unbroken, and the Company agrees that the affected employee will be paid for time lost in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 10.\n48.4 This shall not prevent parties from adjusting a discharge into a disciplinary lay-off without pay for time lost.\n48.5 The provisions of the Paragraph shall not prevent an Arbitrator from exercising his or her rights to modify, reduce or rescind any disciplinary action taken by the Company.\n\nARTICLE X\nLEAVES-OF-ABSENCE\n\n49. A leave of absence for justifiable reason not to exceed thirty (30) days shall be granted by a supervisor to an employee who has acquired seniority, provided that such leave will not interrupt production and there are other available employees in the division who are qualified to do the work.\n    49.1 Emergency leave shall be granted in cases of serious illness in the employee's family.\n50. A leave of absence on account of illness, not to exceed thirty-six (36) consecutive months in duration, shall be granted by the Company to an employee who has acquired seniority, providing, however, the employee's illness and the necessity for such leave is first established by meeting the following eligibility requirements.\n    a) The illness must be substantiated by a statement from a doctor which must be presented to the Company benefits department on or before the end of the shift on the fourth working day of the absence.\n    b) The employee must return completed disability supplement insurance papers within fifteen (15) calendar days.\n    c) The employee must have personally seen a physician during the period of illness in order to qualify for leave.\nd) The Company reserves the right to substantiate the need for leave through the Company doctor or by requiring an independent medical examination.\n\ne) Sickness and Accident pay begins following a waiting period of seven days. Therefore the illness must cause the employee to be totally disabled from work for at least five working days. See the Summary Plan Description for exceptions to the waiting period.\n\n50.1 Upon expiration of an illness leave of four days or more, the employee must present a release from his/her doctor stating the employee is able to return to work. This statement must be presented before the employee can return to active employment.\n\n50.2 Upon expiration of an illness leave an employee incapable of returning to work due to health reasons, such leave will be extended if sufficient medical evidence is presented to justify the extension, however, the total length of the leave shall not exceed five (5) years. The employee may be eligible for medical benefits for the first two (2) years of the medical leave provided the employee has complied with the leave of absence policy. After that, the medical benefits end, but the employee has return rights for up to five (5) years.\n\n50.3 Such employee may accept temporary employment elsewhere providing it is consistent with his or her health condition.\n\n51. Any employee on the payroll on the effective date of this Agreement, who has a year or more seniority, shall upon request to the Company, be granted an educational leave of\nabsence not to exceed one year to attend, as a full-time student, an accredited school or college.\n\n51.1 An employee on a 4-year educational program may renew such leave as needed to complete the program.\n51.2 However, sufficient time must be granted the Company to check the employee's enrollment in the designated school or college before leave can be granted:\n51.3 The terms and conditions, where applicable for such leave, shall be the same as those granted under the other provisions of this Article.\n51.4 Any employee returning from an educational leave shall not again qualify for an educational leave for a period of thirty (30) days.\n\n52. Any employee elected to a public office shall be granted a leave of absence for the term of the elected office and be guaranteed re-employment if there is sufficient work for which he or she is eligible at the then current rate of pay. Any employee elected to a permanent office in, or as a delegate to, any labor activity necessitating a leave of absence, shall be granted such leave not to exceed three years and at the end of the term in the first instance, or at the end of the mission, in the second instance, be guaranteed re-employment if there is sufficient work for which he or she is eligible at the then current rate of pay.\n\n52.1 Seniority will accumulate during the period of such leave, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 53.\n52.2 The Company will be notified in writing of such requests prior to the date of leaving. Other terms and conditions where applicable for such leaves, shall be the same as those granted under other provisions of this Article.\n53. An employee's seniority will accumulate during any leave of absence, limited to an equal amount he or she had at the time the leave was started.\n53.1 Employees who have been on leave for six (6) months or less will return to their job assignment seniority permitting.\n53.2 Employees unable to return to their job assignment or employees on leave for more than six (6) months shall be returned in the same manner as outlined in Paragraphs 37, 38, 39 and 40.\n53.3 However, if upon the expiration of a leave of absence there is no work available for the employee in line with his or her seniority, the employee shall be laid off as of the return to work from leave date. Benefits will expire on this date or the date they would have expired had they been laid off according to their seniority date, whichever is later.\n53.4 Employees on leave of absence will not be denied their rights under provisions outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 34.1.\n\n54. An employee on a medical leave of absence may terminate a leave upon presentation of a doctor's statement to the effect he or she is able to return to work; or upon the employee giving three (3) days advance notice of desire to terminate a non-medical leave.\n\n55. An employee who fails to report for work by the end of their shift on the fourth working day after his or her leave expires shall be considered as voluntarily quit.\n55.1 If there is a satisfactory reason for failure to notify the Company the quit will be voided.\n55.2 If, however, the employee notifies the Company within the four (4) working days that sickness or accident prevents return to\nwork, the leave will be automatically extended if in accordance with Paragraph 50.\n\n56. Any employee who obtains a leave of absence and accepts employment elsewhere, except as otherwise stipulated herein, will be considered as having voluntarily quit.\n\nARTICLE XI\nMILITARY SERVICE\n\n57. The Company agrees to comply with such present or future legislation as may be in effect with respect to the re-employment of employees who are drafted or called into the military service of the United States pursuant to a Military Selective Service Act.

The benefits shall remain in effect so long as the employee remains in\nactive employment. The full premium will be paid by the Company.\n\nARTICLE XXI\nHOSPITAL, SURGICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS\n103 Every employee, having seniority, will receive group hospital, surgical and dental indemnity insurance benefits for themselves and their dependents as provided under the Whirlpool Employee Benefit Plan Group Policy Number 06957. Such plan provides medical and dental insurance benefits for employees and (upon employee's election in accordance with the Plan) the employee's spouse and dependents and may or may not be on a contributory cost basis. The Master Insurance Policy sets forth the provisions of the Insurance Plan. A summary of benefits and other provisions of the Plan are outlined in the Summary of Coverage. The Summary of Coverage contains the principal benefits provided by the Plan, but is not intended as a complete listing of all coverages provided.\n\nARTICLE XXII\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS\n104 The Company will provide a retirement benefit program in accordance with the Production Employees' Retirement Plan, as amended.\n105 Retirees are not eligible for vacation pay after they have retired.

An employee may draw against the above amount for Surgical and Hospital expenses for him or her and/or his or her spouse up to a maximum of $300 per calendar year for 5 years ($1500 maximum). Any employee who has fewer than 12 years credited service at\nretirement may use the $300 yearly maximum until he or she has exhausted the accrued benefits under the provisions of this paragraph. If in any year the medical benefit is not used it shall be carried over to succeeding years. After 5 years, or shorter period if applicable, the unused portion of the maximum medical benefit will be available as needed for Hospital and Surgical expenses.\n\nARTICLE XXIII\nHEALTH, SAFETY AND SANITATION\n107 The Company agrees to install safety devices wherever such devices are needed in order to prevent accidents. The Company will furnish soap, towels, gloves, and incidental articles where necessary for the health and safety of employees. The Safety Supervisor will submit to the Union a list of jobs where gloves are to be furnished. Safety rules and instructions will be posted throughout the plant for the protection of employees.\n108 A competent staff of nurses or First Aid personnel will be available where required and necessary to insure prompt First Aid service to injured employees. Competent medical service will be provided for each employee in case of an accident on Company property. Employees injured on the job and treated outside of Whirlpool will be paid until they are released to return to work from the Medical department. If treatment goes beyond the end of the shift, such employees will be paid to the end of their shift and for any additional time away from work until they are released to return to work or admitted to the hospital up to a maximum of 2 hours at their regular hourly rate on the date of the accident only.\n109 The company agrees to maintain sanitary and healthful conditions in the plants and restrooms with the cooperation of the union and the employees, and provide the necessary apparel and safety equipment to perform work consistent with good safety practices.\n109.1 Employees will receive a safety shoe allowance of $75 per year or $150 every other year.\n\n109.2 In order to make the Evansville Division as safe and healthy a place to work as possible, Whirlpool may utilize safety studies to identify jobs that could lead to musculoskeletal disorder (heavy lifting, awkward posture, repetitive motion). Studies may be conducted on jobs that have resulted in injury or illness, that produce high turnover, or those that receive complaints by employees or the union. The safety department will be responsible for approving the studies and determining what if any actions are necessary to change the jobs. Possible actions to be taken include adding people, modifying work stations, replacing the job with automation, modifying parts, requesting the affected employee to bid to another job or to voluntarily transfer to another seniority division to prevent personal injury, and/or rotating jobs. If the employee moves by bid or by transfer, this \"safety move\" will not count against the normal bid and transfer limitations.\n\nIf the studies show that the only reasonable option is to rotate a job or group of jobs, the following procedure would be followed before rotation would begin:\n\u2022 The jobs to be included in the rotation would be identified by the safety department.\n\u2022 The union representative(s) and affected employee would be notified of the jobs to be rotated.\n\u2022 If there are employees in the identified jobs, they will have two weeks to bid off the jobs. This bid would not count against the normal bids per year allowed to employees.\n\u2022 If employees bid off these jobs, the jobs would be re-bid per the normal bid procedure.\n\u2022 Jobs posted in the future that are part of a rotation group will be posted as such so that the bidding employees know all the jobs they will be required to do.\nAll disagreements regarding any of the above-mentioned actions, if any, shall only be subject to the grievance procedure.\n\n110 Union Safety Representation\n  110.1 The Company and the Union agree to promote habits of safety and health and will cooperate in a program of accident prevention and observance of safety and health rules and regulations. For this purpose, the Union agrees that it will actively encourage employees to observe all the safety and health rules and regulations prescribed by the employer, and to work in a safe manner.\nAlso, for this purpose the Company agrees to recognize a Union Safety Representative(s). The Union Safety Representative(s) will meet with the Safety Representative(s) of the Company. The Union Safety Representative(s) shall be designated in writing by the Union to the Company.

It shall be the policy of the Whirlpool Corporation, Evansville Division, that all apprentices shall be employed in accordance with the terms of this program.\n2. The parties agree that they will not discriminate against any employee because of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, or any other reason.\n\n3. TERMS OF APPRENTICESHIP.\n    3.1 An \"apprentice\" shall mean a person not under the legal age for workers as defined by state and/or Federal law, who has agreed to work at and learn the trade of Tool Maker, Electrician, Carpenter, Millwright, Plumber-Pipe Fitter, Engineering Model Maker, Tool and Gauge Inspector and Charging Board Maintenance, in accordance with the following standards; and who, with the Company, has signed a written apprenticeship agreement (form attached hereto). Such agreement shall be registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.\n    3.2 The term of apprenticeship shall be a minimum of 8,000 hours of work and an additional 576 hours of related technical instruction. The first 1,000 hours shall be considered a probationary period. During this period, annulment of the apprenticeship agreement may be effected by the Company, but notice of such action shall be given to the Union and the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.\n    3.3 The total number of hours assigned to related classroom instruction shall not be less than 144 hours per year, and such time shall not be counted as hours of work as related to the minimum of 8,000 hours required in the term of apprenticeship.\n\n4. QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPRENTICESHIP APPLICANTS. An applicant for apprenticeship should possess the following qualifications:\n4.1 Physical development necessary to enable them to perform all duties of the craft.\n4.2 Be an American citizen or in the process of naturalization.\n4.3 Sufficient education to master the rudiments of the trade. (Normally this would require high school education).\n5. VETERANS' PREFERENCE. Veterans who have been discharged (honorably) will be given preference in this program provided their qualifications are equal to the other candidates.\n6. CREDIT FOR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE. All persons now employed as apprentices will be placed under this program. Such apprentices shall be given full credit for the time they have served as apprentices under a written or verbal agreement. Apprentices who receive credit for previous experience shall be paid upon entrance the wage rate of the period to which such credit advances them.\n6.1 Credit of one year may be allowed for North High School or other trade school students who have completed a minimum of two years in the specific craft or trade with an average or above rating. The wage rate shall be that of the period to which such credit advances them.\n6.2 Other employees of the Company and new employees who desire to become apprentices and are selected will be allowed credit for the applicable experience they have had, after their records have been checked and evaluated by the Training Manager. The wage rate shall be that of the period to which such credit advances them.\n7. CONTINUITY OF EMPLOYMENT. The Company intends and expects to give the apprentice steady\nemployment, but reserves the right to lay him or her off or to curtail his or her working hours whenever business conditions make this course necessary. Apprentices in each skill with the least amount of service in the program will be laid off first, and rehires will be made in reverse order. No additional apprentices will be employed until those laid off have been returned to work under this program.\n\n8. SUPERVISION OF APPRENTICES. In order to properly coordinate the program, the Training Manager shall see that each apprentice progresses from one division of work to the next, in accordance with the schedule and job classification of the trade. The appropriate superintendent will be responsible for overall supervision of the apprentice, and he or she will receive direct supervision from the appropriate supervisor or journeyman.\n\n9. RECORDS. The Training Manager shall prepare adequate record forms to be filled in by the supervisor or journeyman under whom the apprentice receives instruction and experience. Supervisor or journeymen shall make a report quarterly to the Training Manager on the work and progress of apprentices under their direction.
