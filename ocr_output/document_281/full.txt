GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
8. A complaint arising over wages, hours, or working conditions between the Company and the Union as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this agreement, shall be settled as promptly as possible in accordance with the following procedure.

9.2 The employee and Steward shall have ample time and opportunity for private discussion.
9.3 The employee, the Supervisor, and the Steward shall discuss the complaint for the purpose of settling the specified complaint as promptly as possible, if the complaint cannot be thus adjusted then

STEP 1 – By the Chief Steward and the Manager or the appropriate divisional representative of the plant in which the grievance arose, and if not satisfactorily adjusted then, and only then, can a written grievance be submitted by the Steward and/or Chief Steward in accordance with this Article. The Union shall submit the grievance in writing to the Manager or the designated representative of the Company and shall state the Paragraph of the Agreement for which the violation is claimed. The grievance shall be processed as provided herein and shall be presented within ten (10) working days of the alleged violation. The Manager or the designated representative of the Company must give its written decision within two (2) working days. The grievance will be settled in favor of the employee if the Company fails to give its written decision within two (2) working days. The grievance shall be considered cancelled unless the Union notifies the Company in writing within five (5) working days that it is being placed in the 2nd step. Such notification may be made on a form provided by the Company, and a duplicate retained by the Union; but in any event, a grievance shall not be discussed
at the next-scheduled 2nd step meeting unless presented to the 2nd step at least twenty-four hours prior to such meeting.

STEP 2 – By the Union Grievance Committee and other designated representatives of the Union, and a representative or representatives of the Management at regularly scheduled weekly or specially called meetings. The grievance will be settled in favor of the employee if the Company fails to give written disposition within ten (10) working days after the 2nd step grievance meeting in which the grievance was discussed. The grievance shall be considered cancelled unless the Union notifies the Company in writing within ten (10) working days of its intention to panel the grievance for arbitration as provided herein. When an extension of the time limits would contribute to the proper settlement of any grievance, the parties may mutually agree, in writing, to grant such extension. Grievances may be amended in any Step except as limited in paragraph 19. If the grievances are not satisfactorily adjusted, then

STEP 3 – The grievance shall be referred to an Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Article.

10. Retroactive pay settlements of grievances shall be limited to a period not to exceed sixty (60) days prior to the date of filing of such grievance.

However, any income earned by an employee from other normal and regular employment will not be deducted from any retroactive settlement, provided such employment commenced prior to the disciplinary action.

10.1 If a grievance is not presented within the applicable time limit, it shall be barred.

11. Before a Steward leaves his or her job or his or her department to handle a complaint or grievance, he or she shall
obtain permission from his or her Supervisor. Should he or she go into another department, he or she shall report to the Supervisor of that department. In the event an employee is called in by either party to participate in the settlement of an individual employee's complaint or grievance, such employee shall be paid for time so spent at their regular day work rate. These provisions shall apply only to the processing of the grievance by the Manager or the appropriate divisional representative and shall not apply to grievances involving groups of employees.

ARTICLE VII
BID PROCEDURE

29. In the event of any major manpower movement of 35 people or more, the Company will have the right to freeze all manpower placement (as could occur under any contractual manpower movement provision) for no more than five (5) working days in order to complete the move. Any employee affected by this freezing of manpower will be held as excess and placed on the Monday after the move is complete. The supervisor, in making transfers or promotions to available jobs in a seniority division, will give preference to qualified employees having residence in the seniority division where the vacancy exists. Such vacancies shall be listed for bids by
employees in that seniority division and such bids will remain listed for a period not less than 24 consecutive work hours.

29.1 Available job shall mean: a quit, discharge, leave-of-absence, voluntary transfer, military service, death of employee, retiree or an increase in the total manpower of the seniority division and/or an increase in the total manpower of any classification. If an employee on leave of absence or military service never returns to the job the Company has no obligation to re-bid the job he/she vacated.

29.1.1 Available jobs will be bid down to entry-level jobs one time. Afterwards, any resulting vacancy will be filled by Paragraph 29.9 and 34.

29.2 Bids will be accepted only from employees in the seniority division where the vacancy exists. There will be no limit on the number of bids to jobs paying higher day work rate except

29.3 An employee will be limited to four (4) bids within a calendar year to jobs paying the same or lower day work rate and may not bid again to a higher day work rate for a period of ten (10) days.

29.4 From among such qualified bids the employee who has the necessary qualifications and who has the greatest seniority will be given the job. A reasonable training period will be allowed.

29.4.1 An employee who signs a listing of multiple jobs within the same job classification may indicate the specific job he or she is bidding for and will not be considered for any other job within that classification on that listing.

29.4.2 Employees who qualify for two or more available jobs at the same time may have their choice of the jobs.

29.5 Bidding stations will be designated for each seniority division and the listing of vacancies shall include the job classification, job station, department and area, rate of pay, shift, effective date and time and date of listing.
29.6 The Supervisor will advise the Steward of the successful bidder in writing within two (2) working days after the effective date.

29.7 Available jobs will be filled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph before employees with less seniority are placed on available jobs in accordance with Paragraph 37 and 38.

29.8 If there are no bids filed or qualified bidders on upgrade jobs, such vacancies shall be filled by the junior entry-level employee in the division. If there are no qualified bidders in the entry level job such vacancy shall be filled by the junior excess entry level employee in the division, except jobs being filled under Paragraph 34.

29.8.1 If a job is not posted for bid, that vacancy will be offered by seniority to excess employees in that specific job classification on that shift, before the junior excess entry level employee in the division is assigned. In Division 12 the job will be offered by seniority to the excess employees in the supervisor's area of responsibility, before the junior excess entry level employee in the division is assigned, except jobs being filled under paragraph 34.

29.9 The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if there are unassigned or excess employees in the specific job classification.

30. An employee who is promoted or transferred to an available job in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29 and after a reasonable training period fails to satisfactorily perform the requirements of the job will be removed from that job and reassigned, seniority permitting, to the job classification from which he or she was transferred or promoted. In the event he or she does not have seniority to be reassigned in this
classification he or she will be placed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.

30.1 In the event the employee is removed before the end of his or her third (3rd) day on the job, he or she will be placed back on the job he or she vacated.

31. Temporary promotions shall be limited to five (5) working days each and will be offered by seniority to employees capable of doing the job without training time. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will be filled first from the supervisor's area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event a senior employee is bypassed for lack of qualifications, he or she will be notified in a reasonable amount of time.

31.1 In the event no capable employee accepts the temporary promotion, such promotion will be offered by seniority to all division employees. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will first be offered by seniority to employees in the supervisors area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event no employee accepts the temporary promotion then the least senior entry-level employee among those capable will be assigned to the job.

31.2 A temporary promotion for over five (5) working days each will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29.

31.3 The time limits of this paragraph shall not apply to temporary assignment or promotions for replacements for vacations or military service of less than one month. In these cases the employee who is promoted or assigned shall be considered for the entire term of the
vacancy including overtime. Employees shall not be exempt from movement under Paragraph 26, 29.1, 31, 34, 34.1, 37 or 38.

31.4 The Supervisor will notify the Steward of temporary promotions on the day they are made.

31.5 Employees temporarily promoted during the course of a shift shall be paid the higher rate for the entire shift.

32. If an employee with seniority in the bargaining unit is promoted to a factory-related salaried position in the Evansville Division and is thereafter transferred back into the bargaining unit, he or she shall accumulate seniority while working in the factory-related salaried position. When so transferred he or she shall commence work as an hourly-rated employee in line with his or her then seniority ranking and in accordance with Paragraph 37 excluding Paragraph 40.1. All present Supervisors and others holding Supervisory positions who were promoted from factory operations are acknowledged to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph.

33. There will be no discrimination in making job assignments.

ARTICLE IX
LAYOFF

37. When a lay-off (other than temporary) occurs in any given seniority division, an employee affected will, in exercising his or her divisional seniority, fill a vacant job in his or her classification and if not so placed, then

37.1 Displace the junior employee in his or her job classification, seniority permitting, or will be assigned to another classification in his or her division; filling a vacant job in such classification; and if not so placed will displace an employee with less seniority in such rate of pay; provided, however, that he or she has the necessary qualifications to do the work.

37.2 In so doing, he or she shall displace an employee with the shortest seniority possible to allow him or her to exercise this privilege, normally displacing the employee with the least seniority in the job classification.
37.3 An employee thus displaced by a senior employee will be adjusted by the provisions of subparagraph 37.1 or 37.2. In being transferred under this provision, no training time will be allowed, however, an employee assigned under the provisions of this paragraph shall be properly instructed and oriented in the job requirements.

37.4 An employee thus assigned will be given up to a maximum of three (3) days to display their qualifications. In no event will an employee be removed because of qualifications as long as he or she is making satisfactory progress.

38. An employee who has exhausted divisional seniority will temporarily acquire Company-wide seniority status. On or before the eighth working day next following such acquisition of temporary Company-wide seniority status, an employee thus affected will be assigned to another job classification in the Company and:

38.1 Displace an employee with less seniority in such classification, provided, however, that he or she has the necessary qualifications to do the work. In so doing, he or she shall displace an employee with the shortest seniority possible to allow them to exercise this privilege, normally displacing the employee with the least seniority in the job classification.

38.2 An employee who has acquired seniority at the time of lay-off and is thus displaced by a senior employee will be adjusted by the procedure outlined in Paragraphs 37 and 38.

38.3 In being transferred under the provisions of Paragraph 38 no training time will be allowed, however, an employee assigned under the
provisions of this paragraph shall be properly instructed and oriented in the job requirements. Employees transferred under the provisions of paragraph 38 may bid available jobs immediately upon arriving in the new division.

38.4 An employee thus assigned will be given up to a maximum of three (3) days to display their qualifications. In no event will an employee be removed because of qualifications as long as he or she is making satisfactory progress.

38.5 In being transferred under the provisions of Paragraph 38, an employee may designate those job classifications that he or she wishes to be exempted from. This list will consist of the individual classifications submitted in writing to the Employment Office that the employee desires not to be transferred to, and must be received by the Employment Office prior to originating a specific move to be considered.

39. An employee who has acquired seniority but who has not been placed on a job under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 will be subject to recall under the provisions of Sub-Paragraph 34.6.

40. Transfer of an employee under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 shall be made to a job carrying a rate of pay as near that of their former job as seniority permits.

40.1 An employee may be transferred to a higher job classification under the provisions of Paragraphs 37 and 38 provided he or she has previously performed such higher-rated job classification for a sufficient length of time so that no training time would be required, excepting however, under the provisions of
Paragraph 37 the employee must make a request to his or her Supervisor that he or she wishes to be transferred to such higher-rated job classification. An employee displaced by the provisions of this paragraph shall be placed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.

41. When a lay-off (other than temporary) occurs, an employee who because of the provisions of this Article must be assigned to a lower job classification shall notify the Company in writing as to the minimum job rate that he or she will accept in preference to being laid off. An employee may exercise the provisions of this paragraph only when there would be a $.15 or two-labor grade reduction in his or her hourly day work rate.

41.1 An employee affected by the lay-off or rehiring provisions of this Article who declines any job classification properly offered under the provisions of this Agreement, shall not be again considered for a job other than his or regular job classification for a period of ninety (90) days.

41.2 An employee who later desires to change such notice to the Company (during the 90 days) must make application to the Employment Office. At the conclusion of ninety (90) days the employee will be reassigned consistent with his or her written application in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 37.

41.3 Any such employee who refuses a job classification paying the same rate as his or her regular job classification shall be considered as having voluntarily quit.

Physical Restriction or Physical Lay-Off
42. The provisions of Paragraph 41 shall not apply where the employee's physical condition (including workers
compensation restrictions and the use of prescription drugs that prohibit the operation of motor vehicles and/or heavy equipment) prohibits performance of such a job classification. Such an employee shall be relieved of his or her job assignment always replacing the least senior employee possible on a job excluding excess in the following manner:

42.1 The employee will be assigned, seniority permitting, within his or her job classification, by shift, by seniority division, providing the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.

42.2 The employee will be assigned, seniority permitting, within his or her job classification by seniority division, providing the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.

42.3 The employee will be assigned to the next lower rated job classification in his or her seniority division where the least senior employee is assigned and be placed on a job assignment within that classification, provided the assignment is consistent with his or her physical condition.

42.4 When an employee (excluding workers compensation cases) has exhausted his or her seniority rights under paragraph 37 because of physical conditions, he or she will be laid off. Until such time as the physical restrictions have been lifted (or for a maximum of five years), the employee will remain on physical layoff and the Company will conduct a job search plant wide only after an initial 6 week period and subsequently at the beginning of each month at which time the employee will be subject to recall under paragraph 38 (excluding paragraph 40 and 40.1 rights) and
will displace the least senior employee working in line with his or her physical restrictions, provided the recalled employee can safely perform the job for at least one full working day without assistance. All other contractual rights and benefits will be renewed after the employee has successfully performed the job for at least one full working day. In the case of overlooked jobs, back pay will be limited to the time of the most recent plant wide search. The employee will be eligible for subsequent promotion to any job vacancy provided the job is within his or her restrictions or if the doctor revises the restriction the employee will be returned to work under Paragraph 37 excluding Paragraph 40.1.

42.4.1 Plant wide job searches to place people with workers compensation restrictions will be conducted immediately upon receipt of such restrictions until the employee is placed or the restrictions are lifted.

42.5 It is the employee's responsibility to determine from his/her physician whether a prescribed drug may impair his/her job performance or involve hazardous conditions. Should the physical impairment causing the employee's inability to perform a given job assignment be eliminated, a doctor's statement presented by the employee to that effect, and substantiation be given by the Company doctor to that effect, the employee will be considered for any assignment from which he or she was previously demoted due to physical reasons.

42.6 In cases of disagreement between the employee's doctor and the Company doctor, a
third doctor may be called in to make an independent examination and determining judgment and the expenses will be shared equally by the Company and the employee. The third doctor shall be selected by the two doctors first mentioned and shall be a specialist with special training pertinent to the case under consideration.

42.7 The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if the physical restriction is for less than eleven (11) working days. Such employee shall be returned to their regular job assignment. The provisions of the paragraph will not apply when work-related physical restrictions, issued by the company doctor, recommend temporary job placement performing a "restricted work position". This type of assignment would typically occur following an on the job injury or illness, when the employee is unable to safely return to his/her regular position, and in order to prevent the employee from going on Workers Compensation leave. This type of "light duty" assignment may only be made under company doctor's orders and when the work can be safely performed by the employee and to help prevent further injury. An employee may only be placed in a "restricted work position" for a maximum of three (3) weeks, at which time he or she would either return to his or her normal position or be placed in accordance with paragraph 42.4. These light duty positions are not considered "jobs" as defined in other paragraphs of this labor agreement.
43. A lay-off of seven (7) or less working days shall be considered temporary and during such time, work shall be assigned, exclusive of Skilled Trades, to the employee who regularly performs the particular operation on which work is required.

43.1 If more than one employee is employed in performing identical affected operations the employee having the most seniority shall be given first chance to work.
43.2 On or before the eighth working day, the Company will rearrange the working force to comply with the lay-off provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38 and 40.
43.3 An employee who is performing the particular operation, on which work is required during the temporary lay-off, will remain so employed until an employee who is scheduled to replace him or her under Paragraphs 37 and 38 reports for work.
43.4 It is understood that the time element of Paragraphs 38 and 43 of the lay-off provisions will run concurrently.

44. A cessation of work for less than 24 hours shall not be considered a lay-off. Any cessation of work longer than 24 hours will be considered a temporary lay-off and the affected employee may be up for a new job assignment.
Notification of Lay-Off
45. Lay-offs other than temporary:
45.1 Three (3) working days prior to such a lay-off, the Union will be notified as to the approximate number of employees to be laid off and other conditions pertaining to the lay-off, provided there are twenty-five (25) or more persons being laid off. Employees shall be notified at least twenty-four (24) hours previous to their being laid off; and, at the
same time, the District Steward shall be given a complete list of the names of employees to be laid off in his or her district and division.

46. Temporary lay-offs:
    46.1 The Union and the affected employees will be promptly notified of such lay-offs.
    46.2 Verification of the extent of the temporary lay-off will be supplied to the Union in writing within 24 hours.

47. Employees may be loaned from one seniority division to another on a daily basis in order to cover for people absent for any reason (except for weekly vacations) and to relieve bottlenecks. Any employee who is "loaned out" from his or her regular seniority division shall be the least senior excess or unassigned at the time "loan out" occurs. A person can be loaned out of his or her division three times in a day after returning to his/her division for the third time. If a person needs to be loaned out again, the employee will have the option of being loaned out or the employee will be allowed to go home.

Discharges and Disciplinary Lay-Offs

48. Upon the discharge or disciplinary lay-off of any employee, the District Steward or Chief Steward will be notified in the presence of the employee, unless they are not at work at the time of the action.
    48.1 In the event an employee receives a disciplinary suspension a meeting will be held within two (2) days to determine the facts for final adjudication.
    48.2 The time limit may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
    48.3 If such action were proven improper and unjustified, the employee will be reinstated with seniority unbroken, and the Company agrees that the affected employee will be paid for time lost in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 10.
48.4 This shall not prevent parties from adjusting a discharge into a disciplinary lay-off without pay for time lost.
48.5 The provisions of the Paragraph shall not prevent an Arbitrator from exercising his or her rights to modify, reduce or rescind any disciplinary action taken by the Company.

ARTICLE X
LEAVES-OF-ABSENCE

Exceptions to this waiting period are detailed in the Summary Plan Description. In the case of an employee who has been on a disability leave and returns to work for less than 30 consecutive calendar days of full time active work before being placed on another disability leave, the two periods of disability leave will be considered as one leave unless the causes of the two periods of disability are unrelated and the employee has been actively at work for at least one full day between the two periods. The benefits shall remain in effect so long as the employee remains in
active employment. The full premium will be paid by the Company.

The Master Insurance Policy sets forth the provisions of the Insurance Plan. A summary of benefits and other provisions of the Plan are outlined in the Summary of Coverage. The Summary of Coverage contains the principal benefits provided by the Plan, but is not intended as a complete listing of all coverages provided.

ARTICLE XXII
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
104 The Company will provide a retirement benefit program in accordance with the Production Employees' Retirement Plan, as amended.
105 Retirees are not eligible for vacation pay after they have retired. See paragraphs 90 - 97.
106 An employee who retires under the provisions of the Production Employee's Retirement Plan will receive life insurance in a pro-rated amount for each full year of credited service up to a maximum of 30 years and $4,000.00. An employee may draw against the above amount for Surgical and Hospital expenses for him or her and/or his or her spouse up to a maximum of $300 per calendar year for 5 years ($1500 maximum). Any employee who has fewer than 12 years credited service at
retirement may use the $300 yearly maximum until he or she has exhausted the accrued benefits under the provisions of this paragraph. If in any year the medical benefit is not used it shall be carried over to succeeding years. After 5 years, or shorter period if applicable, the unused portion of the maximum medical benefit will be available as needed for Hospital and Surgical expenses.

ARTICLE XXIII
HEALTH, SAFETY AND SANITATION
107 The Company agrees to install safety devices wherever such devices are needed in order to prevent accidents. The Company will furnish soap, towels, gloves, and incidental articles where necessary for the health and safety of employees. The Safety Supervisor will submit to the Union a list of jobs where gloves are to be furnished. Safety rules and instructions will be posted throughout the plant for the protection of employees.
108 A competent staff of nurses or First Aid personnel will be available where required and necessary to insure prompt First Aid service to injured employees. Competent medical service will be provided for each employee in case of an accident on Company property. Employees injured on the job and treated outside of Whirlpool will be paid until they are released to return to work from the Medical department. If treatment goes beyond the end of the shift, such employees will be paid to the end of their shift and for any additional time away from work until they are released to return to work or admitted to the hospital up to a maximum of 2 hours at their regular hourly rate on the date of the accident only.
109 The company agrees to maintain sanitary and healthful conditions in the plants and restrooms with the cooperation of the union and the employees, and provide the necessary apparel and safety equipment to perform work consistent with good safety practices.
109.1 Employees will receive a safety shoe allowance of $75 per year or $150 every other year.

109.2 In order to make the Evansville Division as safe and healthy a place to work as possible, Whirlpool may utilize safety studies to identify jobs that could lead to musculoskeletal disorder (heavy lifting, awkward posture, repetitive motion). Studies may be conducted on jobs that have resulted in injury or illness, that produce high turnover, or those that receive complaints by employees or the union. The safety department will be responsible for approving the studies and determining what if any actions are necessary to change the jobs. Possible actions to be taken include adding people, modifying work stations, replacing the job with automation, modifying parts, requesting the affected employee to bid to another job or to voluntarily transfer to another seniority division to prevent personal injury, and/or rotating jobs. If the employee moves by bid or by transfer, this "safety move" will not count against the normal bid and transfer limitations.

If the studies show that the only reasonable option is to rotate a job or group of jobs, the following procedure would be followed before rotation would begin:
• The jobs to be included in the rotation would be identified by the safety department.
• The union representative(s) and affected employee would be notified of the jobs to be rotated.
• If there are employees in the identified jobs, they will have two weeks to bid off the jobs. This bid would not count against the normal bids per year allowed to employees.
• If employees bid off these jobs, the jobs would be re-bid per the normal bid procedure.
• Jobs posted in the future that are part of a rotation group will be posted as such so that the bidding employees know all the jobs they will be required to do.
All disagreements regarding any of the above-mentioned actions, if any, shall only be subject to the grievance procedure.

110 Union Safety Representation
  110.1 The Company and the Union agree to promote habits of safety and health and will cooperate in a program of accident prevention and observance of safety and health rules and regulations. For this purpose, the Union agrees that it will actively encourage employees to observe all the safety and health rules and regulations prescribed by the employer, and to work in a safe manner.
Also, for this purpose the Company agrees to recognize a Union Safety Representative(s). The Union Safety Representative(s) will meet with the Safety Representative(s) of the Company.

shall be an employee who has knowledge of the practices in the plant.

Such meetings shall consist of the Union Safety Representative(s) and the Representative(s) of the Company, first taking a tour of the plant, after which the parties shall meet together to discuss health and safety matters observed on the tour as well as other health and safety matters. The Company shall keep written minutes of such meetings and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Union, and such minutes shall be reviewed at the next regular meeting.

110.3 The Union Safety Representative(s) shall be allowed pay at their regular day-work rate for time lost off of their regular jobs while attending the meetings with Company representatives, but such time shall not exceed eight hours per month.

110.4 The Company retains sole discretion to determine what action, if any; it should take regarding any suggestions or recommendations that may result from the meetings of the Company representation and the Union Safety representation. All disagreements, if any, regarding such suggestions or recommendations shall only be subject to the grievance procedure.

110.5 The disclosure of such suggestions or recommendations by the Union Safety Representative(s) to the Company shall be made on a confidential basis and shall not be
released to any party without the prior written approval of the Company. Information submitted to the Union Safety Representative(s) by the Company shall be treated as private and confidential and shall not be released to any party without prior written approval of the Company.

118 During regular planning meetings, management will communicate project work to be completed by outside contractors, with Skilled Trades union leaders. Good faith efforts will be made to utilize Whirlpool skilled trades employees prior to consideration of outsourcing. However, management maintains the right to outsource skilled trades work when the expertise and/or equipment does not exist within Whirlpool and/or the required schedule or cost requirements cannot be met. "Expertise" is deemed to include work that is within the normal scope of Whirlpool's existing maintenance work.
In the event management inadvertently fails to communicate a project or part of a project that will be performed by an outside contractor the company will only be responsible for paying employees who would have been
assigned to such work within the constraints outlined above.

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ADDENDUM
WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION
EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, DIVISION
AND
LOCAL 808 IUE-CWA

DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM

Foreword
The purpose of apprenticeship training is to encourage a more careful selection of personnel coming into the trade, to train apprentices now in the trade, to provide training that will equip this employee for profitable employment and good citizenship, and to insure the employer the best possible workmen and the public the best possible workmanship.
• Highly-skilled craftsmen must be capable of exercising independent judgment, understand the theory underlying the work they are called upon to do and the properties of the materials used, know the laws and regulations applicable to their work, and be capable of advancing, in time, to positions requiring leadership and responsibility.
This program has as its broad purpose the establishment and maintenance of high standards of workmanship through the development of highly skilled craftsmen by definite standards of on-the job training, supplemented by the required amount of related technical and theoretical training and instruction.

PROGRAM OF APPRENTICESHIP
1. It shall be the policy of the Whirlpool Corporation, Evansville Division, that all apprentices shall be employed in accordance with the terms of this program.
2. The parties agree that they will not discriminate against any employee because of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, or any other reason.

3. TERMS OF APPRENTICESHIP.
    3.1 An "apprentice" shall mean a person not under the legal age for workers as defined by state and/or Federal law, who has agreed to work at and learn the trade of Tool Maker, Electrician, Carpenter, Millwright, Plumber-Pipe Fitter, Engineering Model Maker, Tool and Gauge Inspector and Charging Board Maintenance, in accordance with the following standards; and who, with the Company, has signed a written apprenticeship agreement (form attached hereto). Such agreement shall be registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.
    3.2 The term of apprenticeship shall be a minimum of 8,000 hours of work and an additional 576 hours of related technical instruction. The first 1,000 hours shall be considered a probationary period. During this period, annulment of the apprenticeship agreement may be effected by the Company, but notice of such action shall be given to the Union and the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.
    3.3 The total number of hours assigned to related classroom instruction shall not be less than 144 hours per year, and such time shall not be counted as hours of work as related to the minimum of 8,000 hours required in the term of apprenticeship.

4. QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPRENTICESHIP APPLICANTS. An applicant for apprenticeship should possess the following qualifications:
4.1 Physical development necessary to enable them to perform all duties of the craft.
4.2 Be an American citizen or in the process of naturalization.
4.3 Sufficient education to master the rudiments of the trade. (Normally this would require high school education).
5. VETERANS' PREFERENCE. Veterans who have been discharged (honorably) will be given preference in this program provided their qualifications are equal to the other candidates.
6. CREDIT FOR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE. All persons now employed as apprentices will be placed under this program. Such apprentices shall be given full credit for the time they have served as apprentices under a written or verbal agreement. Apprentices who receive credit for previous experience shall be paid upon entrance the wage rate of the period to which such credit advances them.
6.1 Credit of one year may be allowed for North High School or other trade school students who have completed a minimum of two years in the specific craft or trade with an average or above rating. The wage rate shall be that of the period to which such credit advances them.
6.2 Other employees of the Company and new employees who desire to become apprentices and are selected will be allowed credit for the applicable experience they have had, after their records have been checked and evaluated by the Training Manager. The wage rate shall be that of the period to which such credit advances them.
7. CONTINUITY OF EMPLOYMENT. The Company intends and expects to give the apprentice steady
employment, but reserves the right to lay him or her off or to curtail his or her working hours whenever business conditions make this course necessary. Apprentices in each skill with the least amount of service in the program will be laid off first, and rehires will be made in reverse order. No additional apprentices will be employed until those laid off have been returned to work under this program.

8. SUPERVISION OF APPRENTICES. In order to properly coordinate the program, the Training Manager shall see that each apprentice progresses from one division of work to the next, in accordance with the schedule and job classification of the trade. The appropriate superintendent will be responsible for overall supervision of the apprentice, and he or she will receive direct supervision from the appropriate supervisor or journeyman.

9. RECORDS. The Training Manager shall prepare adequate record forms to be filled in by the supervisor or journeyman under whom the apprentice receives instruction and experience. Supervisor or journeymen shall make a report quarterly to the Training Manager on the work and progress of apprentices under their direction. These reports shall be placed before the Training Manager for consideration and such action as may be necessary or called for in the agreement.

10. NUMBER OF APPRENTICES TO BE TRAINED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.
  10.1 The Company may have a minimum of three apprentices in the trade, and additional apprentices may be employed on the following basis:
    Three apprentices to each seven Class I Tool Makers
    Three apprentices to each seven Class I Electricians

11. COMPLETION OF APPRENTICESHIP. Upon the successful completion of the apprenticeship, under this program, and upon the recommendation of the Company, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training will furnish each apprentice and the Union with a Certificate of Apprenticeship. The Company will likewise furnish each successful apprentice a Company certificate. No apprentice shall be granted such certificates until he or she has complied in all respects with the terms of this agreement.

13. RELATED SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. The apprentice shall enroll in and attend classes in subjects related to his or her trade for not less than 144 hours per year during the apprenticeship. These courses must be passed with grades satisfactory to the Training Manager. The related classroom instruction shall be under the direction of the Training Manager. The Training Manager shall act in an advisory and consultant capacity in determining subjects to be taught, and in any other problems pertaining to related education of apprentices.

    In case of failure on the part of the apprentice to fulfill his or her obligation with respect to school attendance (except in cases of sickness or injury), the Company shall have the authority to suspend or revoke the agreement with the individual.

14. HOURS OF WORK. The hours of work for apprentices shall be paid for and conform to the stipulations of the Agreement between the Company and the Union, excepting, however, that hours spent in supplemental school instruction shall be paid for at the regular rate excluding overtime.

15. WAGES. The rates of pay for apprentices shall conform to the wage schedule stipulated in the Wage Addendum of the Agreement between the Company and the Union, dated February 19, 2009. Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship program
the full journeyman rate of the particular trade will become effective on graduation date.

16. WORK EXPERIENCE. During the term of apprenticeship, the apprentice shall be given such instruction and experience on the processes and operations herein listed for the trade as are necessary to develop a practical skilled mechanic. The time on any process or operation need not be continuous due to the diverse nature of shop operations. During the last half of the third year and first half of the fourth year of apprenticeship, approximately 500 hours of the schedule may be used for miscellaneous related work. The apprentice shall perform such other duties in the shop and on the job as are commonly related to apprenticeship.
