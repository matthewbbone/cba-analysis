SECTION IX - HOURS OF WORK

906. Eight (8) consecutive hours, exclusive of the meal period, shall constitute a day's work. The working hours shall be between the hours of 4:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch. Lunch periods shall be scheduled not later than five (5) hours after the start of work. An employee required to work during his lunch period shall receive time and one-half of his regular hourly rate for such time. The employee must be allowed time to eat lunch as soon as possible. An earlier starting time or deviation of the scheduled meal time may be arranged upon the approval of a majority of the employees on the job in a poll conducted by the steward, provided that no work is started prior to 4:30 a.m. without agreement of the Union before starting time or meal period. The Employer shall give written notification of the deviation in starting time or meal period to the Union not less than 24 hours prior to the starting time of the deviation, and such notice shall contain the following information:

1. Address of job.
2. Starting deviation hour or meal period.
3. Starting date for deviation.
4. Reason for deviation.
5. Approximate ending date of deviation.

901. Shift starting time on high-rise project above six stories shall commence at ground level elevator entrance.

902. Overtime rates shall not be paid for work performed before 4:30 a.m. Monday through Friday, on jobs where deviation in starting time was performed in compliance with the provision of this Section. In the event an Employer fails to give proper notice to the Union of a deviation in starting time or fails to comply with the terms of this Section, the Employer shall be considered in violation of the Agreement and shall be required to pay for all time worked prior to 4:30 a.m. at the rate of time and one-half (1½X) Monday through Saturday, or double time (2X), if occurring on a Sunday or holiday.

903. The regular work week shall consist of five (5) days, Monday through Friday. OVERTIME RATES: First two (2) hours outside the regular constituted shift shall be at the rate of time and one-half (1½X). Vacation Savings are part of the total taxable rate and therefore are multiplier of overtime, either at time and one-half (1½X) or double-time (2X).

904. Saturdays up to the first ten (10) hours shall be at the rate of time and one-half (1½X). All additional hours and Sundays and holidays shall be the rate of double time (2X). When working on Sundays and holidays, there will be $1.50 per hour additional paid to Pension Annuity. Employees must be given an eight (8) hour break between the termination of any work and the commencement of another straight time shift, except in cases of emergency.
