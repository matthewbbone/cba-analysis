(a) For each hour, for which an employee receives pay, the Employer shall make a contribution of forty cents ($0.40) for Apprenticeship Training, and ten cents ($0.10) for Journeyman Training. It is understood that the contributions and Programs are administered by a single Board of Trustees, however it is agreed that for accounting purposes, contributions and disbursements shall be processed through separate accounts. Future rates are as follows: Effective July 1, 2008: forty-two cents ($0.42) for Apprenticeship Training, eleven cents ($0.11) for Journeyman Training; Effective July 1, 2009: forty-five cents ($0.45) for Apprenticeship Training, twelve cents ($0.12) for Journeyman Training; Effective July 1, 2010: forty-nine cents ($0.49) for Apprenticeship Training, thirteen cents ($0.13) for Journeyman Training. It is understood that if it is determined that additional contributions to the training fund are not needed, those contributions will revert to wages.

(b) For the purpose of this Article, each hour paid for, including hours attributable to show-up time and other hours for which pay is received by the employee in accordance with this Agreement, shall be counted as hours for which contributions are payable.

(c) Contributions shall be paid on behalf of any employee starting with the employee's first day of employment in a job classification covered by this Agreement. This includes all indentured apprentices and journeymen of Painters Local Union #159.

(d) The payments to the Apprenticeship and Training Fund required above shall be made to the Painters Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee which was established under an Agreement and Declaration of Trust, dated May 1, 1966. The Employer hereby agrees to be bound by and to the said Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as though he had actually signed the same.

(e) From the funds collected in the above manner, the trustees of the Painters Joint Apprenticeship shall hold in trust the sum of five cents ($0.05) per hour, for each hour or portion thereof for which an employee receives pay, and remit said sum to the Finishing Trades Institute (FTI) at such regular periods of time and in the manner and form as shall be determined by the trustees of the FTI from time to time.
