227. This Agreement shall apply to all work performed in the Employer's warehouses, shops or yards which have been particularly provided or set up to handle work in connection with a job or project, covered by the terms of this Agreement, and all of the production or fabrication of materials by the Employer for use on the projects will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

228. During the term hereof, there shall be no strikes, slowdowns, or stoppages of work occasioned by jurisdictional disputes between the Union signatory hereto and any other Union.
