The Union may withhold or withdraw workers from the Contractor for failure to comply with this Section 1.\n\n301.2 In the event an employer takes over the performance of the contract covered by the terms of this Agreement for another employer, the successor employer shall notify the Contract Administration Committee by certified mail of its intent to undertake performance of the contract. Such notice shall be given prior to commencing work. Failure to give such notice shall subject the successor contractor to claims for any delinquent fringe benefits of the predecessor contractor through the grievance procedure in addition to any other claims which may arise because of such failure.\n\n302. To the extent required by state law, the Employer shall be financially responsible for all wages and fringe benefit payments owed to any workmen or any funds established by this Agreement by the Employer's Subcontractor, or the Subcontractor of a Subcontractor, to any workmen or any Fund contributions required in this Agreement for work performed on the Employer's job or project, provided there has been an appropriate demand made in writing to recover said wages and fringe benefits. If the Employer has included the delinquent Subcontractor on a duly filed Job Registration Form, a copy of such demand will be furnished to the Employer. If the state law is amended to relieve the Employer of such responsibility, then this Section shall continue to be applicable on the Employer's responsibility to the extent of any monies remaining due from the Employer to the Subcontractor who is liable for wages or fringe benefit contributions.\n\n303. Prior to implementation of this paragraph, the Union or Trust Fund will make a good faith effort to promptly notify the Employer of any and all delinquencies of the Subcontractor and make a good faith effort to exhaust execution of the Subcontractor's bond or bonds.\n\n304. The terms and conditions of this Agreement insofar as it affects the individual Employer shall apply to any subcontractor under the control of or working under contract with the individual Employer upon work covered by this Agreement, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered as the individual Employer. Any subcontractor performing work under the jurisdiction of this Agreement must furnish all materials and equipment for the fabrication and/or installation thereof (except carpenter hand tools) and must compensate carpenters at the wage rates, fringe benefits and working conditions as specified in this Agreement.\n\n305. For purposes of this Agreement, a subcontractor is any person (other than an employee covered by this Agreement), firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity that holds a valid State Contractor's License, wherever required by law, and who agrees under contract in writing with the Employer or in writing with his subcontractors to perform any work covered by this Agreement and who employs workmen as employees to perform services\nunder this Agreement, who agrees in writing to perform for or on behalf of an Employer or other subcontractor any part or portion of the work covered by this Agreement.\n\n306. The Employer and his subcontractors shall refrain from the use of materials which will tend to cause discord or disturbance on the job site.\n\n307. The terms and conditions set forth in this Section III apply to bargaining unit work only. The Union may withhold or withdraw workers from the Employer or subcontractor for failure to comply with this Section III (301), only after first (1st) notifying the employer or subcontractor in writing 48 hours before withdrawing workers from the employer or subcontractor.\n\n308. The parties recognize and acknowledge the importance of prompt remedial action to collect delinquent fringe benefit contributions from Employers of Subcontractors who are habitually delinquent in their payments to the Funds and will use their good faith efforts to encourage such action. The parties also recognize the responsibility to file appropriate documents in connection with bankruptcy of any Employer or Subcontractor as part of a prudent effort to collect unpaid wages or fringe benefit contributions.\n\nSECTION IV - APPLICABILITY\n\n400. The parties agree that in the event the Union party hereto shall negotiate different terms and conditions of employment for employees performing job site construction industry work in classifications similar to those set forth in this Agreement in the work and territorial jurisdiction of the Union signatory hereto, no Employer signatory to this Master Labor Agreement shall be required to provide terms or conditions of employment under this Master Labor Agreement any more favorable than such terms and conditions contained in such other construction industry agreements concerning jobsite work within the territorial jurisdiction of this Agreement. This provision shall not be applicable to a maintenance or special project agreement that may be negotiated by the Union with an employer not signatory or bound to this Master Labor Agreement.\n\nSECTION V - WAGE SCALES\n\n500. No employee receiving total compensation (i.e., wages and payments to trust funds for vacation, health and welfare, pensions and subsistence) under an existing agreement between an individual Union and any Employer shall suffer any reduction in such compensation by reason of the execution of this Agreement.\n\n501.

WELDING. The classifications of Carpenter-Welder and Millwright-Welder shall receive $1.00 per hour over their respective Journeyman's rate. A carpenter-welder shall be defined a workman who holds a valid AWS D1.1 (Heavy Plate) or D1.3 (Light Gauge) certification; or other welding certification relevant to the scope of the job. And who has been dispatched as a certified welder or has been assigned by the Employer to weld on work which his or her certification is required. This includes welding in panel yards or offsite for a project covered by this Agreement on work like precast and theming. For carpenter-welder classification this does not include miscellaneous or incidental welding of short duration or time accumulated of less than three (3) hours a day.\n\n506. A millwright-welder shall be defined as a workman who performs work described as fusion, welding, brazing, soldering, burning and cutting of all materials. All millwright-welders shall receive the premium for the entire shift in which he performs work defined as a welding operation. Any carpenter who uses a hand held or tractor mounted oxyfuel torch, plasma arc torch or any other thermal cutting device for the purpose of cutting, burning, shaping, or fabricating of any material, for 4 hours or more in a single shift, shall also qualify for the 8 hours of welders' premium. Any apprentice who meets the above descriptions shall receive the premium for welder.\n\n507. In the event that the scope of work demands certification beyond or other than AWS D1.1 or D1.3, it is agreed that the employer shall bear the expense of such certification. It is also agreed that the employer will provide, for each employee who meets the definition of carpenter or millwright-welder all gloves, welding hoods with proper filter lenses as per the standards of ANSI Z49.1 Sec. E4.2.1.1, replacement cover lenses, leathers or sleeves, wire brushes, chipping hammers, soap stone and other necessary equipment required to safely and properly perform the work of a welder. Also the employer shall replace these items in the event they become unusable due to wear or damage associated with welding operations.\n\n508. Each employer shall provide a letter on company letterhead, to each welder employed. If the employee requests the welding qualifications letter in writing, this letter shall include employees name, Social Security number and verification that the welder performed work under the scope of his individual certification. The contractor, if requested in writing, shall provide an employee a copy of his welding records including a copy of his certification, procedures used and letter of welding qualification. Each employer shall recognize the letters of other signatory employers as verification of work performed under the standards of AWS D1.1 Sec. 4.1.3.1 and D1.3 Sec 4.9. These letters must be issued not later than the 15th of the month following the end of each six month period or upon separation from the employer due to the completion of the project. If a welder is terminated or leaves the employer prior to the end of the project then such letter and\ninformation shall be produced within two weeks or ten working days of receipt of the written request for the information.\n\n509. FOREMAN: The hourly wage scale for carpenter foreman shall be 9% above the journeyman carpenter wage rate. The hourly wage scale for carpenter general foreman shall be 9% above the carpenter foreman wage rate.\n\n510. When an employee works in more than one classification for any portion of a day, he shall receive the rate of the highest classification for all work performed for that entire day.\n\n511. All other classifications under the jurisdiction of the Union not designated herein shall receive not less than journeyman carpenter's scale as specified above, except apprentices and their classification herein described. The parties hereto may establish wage rates different than the apprenticeship wage rates for employees under a manpower development training program. Some consideration will be given to providing summer employment for undergraduate engineering students.\n\n512. Indentured carpenter apprentices shall receive the following wages based on the following percentage of journeymen's base rates of pay and fringe benefit contributions per the schedule listed below:\n\n512.1 APPRENTICE SCHEDULE\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Schedule of Periods</th>\n    <th>%</th>\n    <th>Schedule</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1st months<br>(Minimum 600 hours)</td>\n    <td>50</td>\n    <td>(1)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2nd 6 months<br>(Minimum 600 hours)</td>\n    <td>60</td>\n    <td>(2)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2nd year<br>(Minimum 1200 hours)</td>\n    <td>70</td>\n    <td>(2)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3rd year<br>(Minimum 1200 hours)</td>\n    <td>80</td>\n    <td>(3)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>4th year<br>(Minimum 1200 hours)</td>\n    <td>90</td>\n    <td>(3)</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n512.2 SCHEDULE OF FRINGE BENEFITS FOR APPRENTICES\n\n512.2.1 1st 6 months \u2013 Health & Welfare, Apprenticeship, Grievance and Arbitration Administrative Trust Fund, Drywall/Lathing Industry Labor Management Cooperation Committee, Supplemental Dues, Carpenters International Training Fund.\n\n512.2.2 2nd 3rd & 4th 6 months \u2013 Health & Welfare, Vacation, Apprenticeship, Grievance and Arbitration Administrative Trust Fund, Drywall/Lathing Industry Labor Management Cooperation Committee, Supplemental\nDues, Carpenters International Training Fund, Pension \"A\" contribution, Carpenters-Contractors Cooperation Committee.\n\n512.2.3  3rd & 4th years \u2013 all current fringes\n\n512.3  Carpenter Pre-Apprentice\n\n512.3.1 As a prelude to apprenticeship.

This period shall commence from the date of notice to proceed. If specific provisions appear in the bid document such as special shifts, night or weekend work, and they are in conflict with the Master Labor Agreement, they may be appealed to the Work Preservation Committee. On public works, the one dollar and fifty cents, ($1.50), on Annuity for Sundays and holidays shall not apply. If the Federal Davis Bacon Act or State Prevailing Wage Law is repealed or amended, the contract may be reopened for affected sections. When an employee has been prevented from working for reasons\nbeyond the control of the Employer, such as inclement weather, or mechanical failure, during the regularly scheduled work week, upon prior written notification to the Union, a makeup shift (whole day only) may be worked on Saturday for which the employee shall receive eight (8) hours pay at the straight-time rate of pay. This section will only be applicable if all craft employees are on a straight-time makeup day.\n\n514. It is the obligation of each employer to complete the State Prevailing Wage Survey or the Form or to allow the Union to perform it for them.\n\n515. Special Single Shifts: On Public Works Projects; When the Contractor produces evidence in writing to the Union twenty-four (24) hours in advance of a bona-fide job requirement that work can only be performed outside the regular day shift due to safety conditions, or other requirements, an employee shall work eight (8) consecutive hours, exclusive of meal period, for which he shall receive eight (8) hours pay at the straight-time rate of pay, Monday through Friday. All time worked or hours paid for Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall be paid for at the appropriate overtime rate.

WORK PRESERVATION COMMITTEE: The parties to this Agreement recognize the necessity of assuring the competitive position of the parties within the industry during the term of this Agreement. Consistent with that recognition, the parties will continually monitor the effectiveness of this Agreement during its term as may be necessary to assure the work opportunities of the employees and the competitive position of the individual employers. To implement the intent of this paragraph, the parties to this Agreement hereby establish a Committee composed of three (3) representatives appointed by the Union and three (3) representatives appointed by the Painting & Decorating Contractors of America. This Committee will review requests for changes in the terms and conditions of the Agreement that may be necessary to preserve work opportunities for employees and individual employers covered by the Agreement. The Committee is authorized to approve and implement such changes as it deems to be in the best interest of the parties to the Agreement.\n\nSECTION VI - PLANS & FUNDS\n\n600. The Contractors signatory to this Agreement agree to comply with all the terms set forth in the Agreements establishing: (1) the Southwest Carpenters Pension Trust, dated September 14, 1959; (2) the Southern Nevada Carpenters Annuity Fund dated July 1, 1989; (3) the Southwest Carpenters Health & Welfare Trust, dated February 8, 1955; (4) the Southwest Carpenters Training Fund, dated May 1, 1960; (5) the Southwest Carpenters Vacation Trust, dated April 1, 1962; and (6) the Contractors Grievance and Arbitration Trust and (7) Contract Administration Trust, (hereafter collectively referred to as the \"Carpenters Trust Funds\") and any amendments, modifications, extensions and renewals of such Trust Agreements. Such Trust Agreements are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement.\n\n601. The Contractor agrees to pay the Carpenters Trust Funds the sums in the amounts and manner provided for in this Agreement (see Section V Wage Scales) and the Trust Agreements and\nfurther agrees to be bound by the Trust Agreements, and Rules and Procedures adopted by the Trustees, and all amendments; and modifications thereto and further agrees that it does irrevocably designate and appoint the Employers mentioned in the Trust Agreements along with representatives designated by the United General Contractors, Inc., as its attorney-in-fact, for the selection or removal of Trustees as provided by or pursuant to the Trust Agreements.\n\n602. Included in the contributions called for herein, the parties agree that each signatory employer will make a contribution to the Carpenters' International Training Fund and to the UBC Labor Management Education and Development Fund (hereafter \"International Funds\") in such amounts as allocated by the Union. Payment to the International Funds shall be made to such collection agent as is designated by the Union on or before the 20th day of the month following the month of the work performed. Currently four cents per hour is contributed to the International Training Fund. These contributions may be collected with the existing contributions to one of the existing Carpenters Trust Funds or other Carpenter funds, upon approval of the Trustees of those Funds and as allocated by the Union. The Employer agrees to be bound to the Agreements and Declarations of Trust for the International Funds as they exist and as they may be amended or restated, and to such rules, regulations and other governing documents adopted pursuant to such Trusts. Upon request the employer may receive the latest annual report prepared for the Funds.\n\n603. Each individual Employer covered by this Agreement will contribute the sum of $2.85 cents for each hour compensated to carpenters employed by such individual Employer under this Agreement to the Carpenters Southern Nevada Pension Trust Fund. This amount is reflected in the Pension contribution set forth in Section V. When work on Sundays and Holidays is done, there will be a $.150 premium paid for each hour of compensation under this Agreement.\n\n604. Supplemental Dues\n\n604.1 Subject to the following conditions, the Contractor agrees that he will remit to the Southwest Carpenters Vacation Trust on a monthly basis for every hour worked or paid for by employees covered by this Agreement the amount designated herein (See Section 5 Wage Scales) as vacation pay. If his employees sign a written authorization to do so, the Administrator of the Vacation Trust will deduct from that amount the sum of ninety-five cents ($0.95) per hour or the amount of Supplemental Dues that are lawfully required by the Union. In implementing the foregoing the Carpenters Southwest Administrative Corporation has been designated as Agent for the purpose of receiving and holding written authorization cards and for receiving, holding and allocating and distributing the dues monies.\n\n604.2 Said Supplemental Dues will be transmitted to said Agent concurrently with, but not as a part of, the Employers monthly vacation contributions with respect to his employees covered by this Agreement to the Southwest Carpenters Vacation Trust. All sums deducted by the Employers pursuant to the provision of this Article will, from the instant of their deduction, be considered dues if proper authorization will have been furnished. All other sums transmitted by the Employers pursuant to the provisions of this Article will, from the instance of their transmittal, be considered vacation contributions if no such proper authorization will have been furnished, and will be held by the Vacation Trust for the\naccount of the employee. Prior to the deposit in the separate bank accounts of the Agent, on the one hand, and the Vacation Trust, on the other, the bank will separate the funds transmitted into dues and vacation contributions, respectively, based on whether or not a proper dues deduction authorization will have been filed. The bank will then deposit such sums in the account of either the Agent or the Vacation Trust. The Union will bear the responsibility for furnishing the written authorization referred to above. All costs incident to receipt, administration and remittance to the Union of the Supplemental Dues payment will be borne by the Union. This provision will not reduce the obligations of the Contractor to pay the full amount of vacation contributions specified in this Agreement. All written authorizations referred to above will be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of the execution and will renew automatically from year to year, unless the employee, by written notice served upon the Local Union and/or the Agent not more than twenty (20) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the first year or any year thereafter, will have revoked such authorization.\n\n604.3 The amount payable to the Vacation Fund on overtime work shall be paid in an amount reflecting the overtime premium payment.\n\n605.

The Employer agrees to abide by the rules adopted by the Trustees of the Pension and Health and Welfare Fund governing contributions on behalf of superintendents.\n\n606. APPRENTICESHIP: The Employer and the Union agree to establish and operate a Joint Apprenticeship Committee for carpenters.

Such contributions shall be made to the \"Carpenters Joint Apprenticeship Committee Fund.\" The employment of apprentices shall be governed under conditions established in accordance with this paragraph (g) and under the rules and regulations of the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.\n\n608. The Trustees of the Joint Apprenticeship Committee shall have the authority to establish new training programs to provide journeyman carpenters with training regarding upgrading such carpenters on technology, materials and new methods of work that are related to the carpenters and\nmillwright trades. Such programs shall be established within existing contributions and available funds.\n\n609. A Contractor may employ one (1) apprentice for every two (2) journeymen. The Contractor must hire one (1) apprentice after ten (10) journeymen, including the foreman. After the first ten (10), then for every five (5) journeymen he must employ one (1) apprentice if available.

Two (2) apprentices may be employed with each journeyman on Insulation Work.\n\n610. GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION/ADMINISTRATION TRUST FUND: There is hereby established a Grievance and Arbitration/Administration Trust Fund. The purposes of the Trust are to establish and administer procedures to process grievances and to provide third party independent arbitration on disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement that may occur between the employer or individual employer and the Union. Additionally, the purposes will include establishing, implementing and administering uniform labor relations policies and assisting in the negotiations of any modification, amendment, change, extension or renewal of this Agreement or any subsequent agreement on behalf of signatory members of the Association and those individual Employers who, under a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, are so obligated to contribute.

Any action to secure compliance with the provisions of this Article, or to secure audit entry in order to perform such audits as may be required or requested pursuant to this Agreement, shall be brought and tried in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the city limit of Las Vegas, and each party to such action expressly waives any right to change venue of such action to any other county or any other place. If any individual Contractor refuses audit entry as required by this Agreement, and if an action is filed to complete audit entry, the individual\nContractor shall be required to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by such failure in addition to any other relief which may be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n614.4 In addition the Regional Council shall have the right to withdraw employees and refuse to dispatch workers to any individual Contractor who refuses audit entry within seven (7) calendar days or who refuses to make available relevant records necessary for the completion of the audit.\n\n614.5 The CAC shall submit evidence of any alleged violation of this Agreement to the Association and the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, and shall then submit the matter to the Joint Adjustment Board for adjudication as though the complaint or grievance were filed by a Local Union, an individual Contractor or an individual worker.\n\n614.6 In case the auditors designated by the Board of Trustees conduct an audit and determine that a Contractor has violated the provisions of this Agreement for hours worked (or paid for) in that the gross compensation, including any remuneration or compensation not required or permitted by this Agreement, divided by hours reported, exceeds the employee's base rate plus One Dollar ($1.00) per hour, or if adequate records are not made available to allow the auditor to make his determination in that regard, or if hours worked for each payroll period are not recorded on payroll records, then the auditors shall calculate or estimate gross compensation including any remuneration or compensation not permitted in this Agreement from whatever information is available. This amount determined to be the gross compensation, when divided by the appropriate hourly wage, exclusive of vacation and other fringe benefits, and then multiplied by the appropriate hourly fringe benefit contribution rate according to this Agreement, shall be considered due the respective Trust Funds.\n\n614.7 The failure to register jobs as required by Article III of this Agreement and/or the failure to report accurately all hours worked in a given period to the respective Trust Funds and/or to pay fully the required amounts to said Trust Funds as required by Article V of this Agreement shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to violate this Agreement and shall require the auditors to apply the above-stated formula to determine the amount due the respective Trust Funds. The amount determined to be due by the application of the above formula shall be paid by the individual Contractor to the respective Trust Funds, unless challenged through the grievance procedure within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the demand for payment.\n\n614.8 If the Contractor fails to pay the said amount, and if a grievance is filed, the Joint Adjustment Board or arbitrator shall be authorized to assess damages in addition to any other remedies deemed appropriate by the Joint Adjustment Board or the arbitrator.\n615. The failure to register jobs, and/or accurately report hours on jobs as required by this Agreement, shall entitle all of the Trusts to assess fringe benefits based upon the reports of the CAC field personnel as to their estimate of the hours that should have been paid on the particular job or jobs. Such estimate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount due and owing unless the estimate is found by the Joint Adjustment Board and/or the arbitrator to be arbitrary and capricious.\n\n616. All payments required to be made by each Employer to the Vacation Savings Plan, the Health and Insurance Trust Fund, Grievance and Arbitration Administration Trust Fund, Carpenters Contractors Cooperation Committee, Contract Administration Trust, the Carpenters International Training Fund, the Pension Trust Fund, the Joint Apprenticeship Committee and the Journeyman Upgrading Fund, when applicable, under this Section shall be due and payable to the appropriate trust fund and Joint Apprenticeship Committee no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month for all hours worked by employees covered by this Agreement during the preceding month. An Employer who has not made such payments by the twentieth (20th) day of the month shall be considered in violation of the Agreement and a delinquent Employer. The grievance and arbitration procedure contained in Section XV shall not apply to any cases involving the failure of a contractor to pay fringe benefits as required herein. The Union shall take appropriate action against the Employer or Subcontractor who is delinquent in the payment of fringe benefit contributions under this Agreement, up to and including the withholding of manpower.\n\n617. A list of Subcontractors or others who are delinquent in payment of fringe benefit contributions under this Agreement will be provided monthly to Employers and Employer Associations representing Employers, as close as reasonably possibly to the first of the next month succeeding the due date of reports referenced above.\n\n618.

Any such action by the Union shall not be in violation of the Strike, Prohibition provisions set forth in this Agreement.

There is hereby established a Joint Adjustment Board for Southern Nevada for all grievances and claims arising under this Agreement and it shall be known as \"The Southern Nevada Joint Adjustment Board for the Drywall Industry.\"\n\n1501.1 The Board shall be composed of four representatives and their alternates selected by the Association and four representatives and their alternates selected by the Union.\n\n1501.2 In addition to the employer and employee members, the Board shall have as a member an individual who shall be a permanent neutral arbitrator who shall sit as the chairman of the Board and shall attend meetings as scheduled. The permanent neutral arbitrator, who shall have no business connection with either party to this Agreement, shall be authorized to participate in the proceedings and if the Joint Adjustment Board is unable to reach a majority vote, the arbitrator shall render the deciding vote. The decision of the Joint Adjustment Board and/or the decision of the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement and shall have the effect of a legal judgment.\n\n1501.3 A quorum of the Board shall consist of one employer member and one Union member along with the arbitrator. All decisions of the Joint Adjustment Board shall be by majority vote, with each party having equal voice and vote.\n\n1501.4 Any individual employer against whom a grievance or claim has been filed may, upon demand, require that the arbitrator make the decision in the case rather than the Joint Adjustment Board. In the event that any individual employer fails to appear or refuses to participate in the grievance proceedings, the grievance or claim against said individual employer shall be processed and upon submission by the charging party or parties, the Joint Adjustment Board or the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall make a decision concerning said grievance or claim. No decision\nconcerning an individual contractor who fails or refuses to appear shall be made unless the neutral arbitrator issues said decision.\n\n1502. The Joint Adjustment Board and the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have the power to adjust grievances and disputes, make awards of back pay, levy fines for violations of the Agreement, and assess liquidated damages in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, which shall be final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement. The Joint Adjustment Board may, as part of a remedy in any case before it, order an increase of the bonding requirements specified in this Agreement up to a maximum of $30,000.00, or an amount equivalent to the average of the three (3) highest contributing months within the previous twelve (12) month period, whichever is greater, and may specify the effective date of such bonding requirements.\n\n1503. The parties recognize and acknowledge that compliance with the requirements to pay wages, fringe benefits, and to abide by the provisions of this Agreement is essential for maintenance of this Agreement, the health and safety of workers covered thereunder, the fairness to all parties (including the Union, employees and employers in the industry), and that it would be extremely difficult if not impracticable to fix the actual expense and damage to the workers, and the Union, and the industry, for any failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any liquidated damages assessed by the Joint Adjustment Board or the arbitrator shall become due and payable to the Joint Adjustment Board as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Neither the Joint Adjustment Board nor the impartial arbitrator shall have the authority to modify, vary, change, add to or remove any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n1504. In addition to any rules and procedures which the Panel may adopt, the Joint Adjustment Board and the permanent neutral arbitrator shall be governed by the following provisions:\n\n1504.1 All proceedings shall be done in an expedited manner and no briefs, transcripts or written opinions shall be required unless specifically requested by any parties to the grievance or unless ordered by the permanent neutral arbitrator.

Any\nsurplus funds shall be turned over to the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Trust for the sole and exclusive use by said Apprenticeship Trust Fund.\n\n1504.4 Any grievance or dispute to be submitted shall be presented to the Joint Adjustment Board within thirty (30) days after the complaining party has actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the dispute or, when further discovery is necessary, the complaining party has made final determination of the facts giving rise to the dispute. Whenever possible before submission of the dispute to the Joint Adjustment Board, representatives of the Regional Council and the individual contractor shall attempt to adjust the matter. If after twenty-four (24) hours the matter cannot be adjusted between the respective parties, either party may submit the matter to the Joint Adjustment Board, which shall render a decision within the limits and subject to the provisions of this Article and applicable rules and regulations.\n\n1504.5 Repeated violators of this Agreement shall lose the rights of the 24-hour adjustment provisions of this section.\n\n1504.6 The Joint Adjustment Board or arbitrator may, as part of a remedy, require a contractor to submit weekly reports of workers and hours worked to the Contract Administration Committee.\n\n1504.7 In any grievance in which the arbitrator is requested to issue an expanded opinion, the arbitrator shall not be required to render such an opinion unless the party requesting the same guarantees to pay any additional charges or expenses of such services. The decision of the arbitrator of the Joint Adjustment Board shall be issued within thirty (30) days following completion of the proceedings.\n\n1504.8 Charges and expenses incurred as the result of special hearing or hearings heard on days other than the regular scheduled meeting date of the Joint Adjustment Board, shall be payable by the party requesting such special hearings and shall not be the responsibility of the Contract Administration Committee.\n\n1505. A decision of the Joint Adjustment Board or the decision of the permanent neutral arbitrator shall be enforceable by petition to confirm an arbitration award filed in the Superior or Municipal Court of the City and County of Las Vegas for all proceedings of the Southern Nevada Joint Adjustment Board. Alternatively, such petition may be filed or tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Nevada.\n\n1506. Any party who fails or refuses to comply with the decisions of the Joint Adjustment Board or an award of the permanent neutral arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be responsible for reasonable attorney's fees for the filing and trial of any petition to confirm and enforce said decision or award in addition to all other remedies available through law.\n\n1507. If any party hereto fails to comply with the decision of the Joint Adjustment Board or the permanent neutral arbitrator, the Union may withdraw employees or strike the individual employer, and such action shall not be a violation of this Agreement so long as such non-compliance\ncontinues. Said right to withdraw employees or strike shall be in addition to all other remedies available herein.\n\n1508. Whenever the Union has the right pursuant to the Terms of this Agreement to withdraw or refuse to refer workers, such rights shall coexist with the right to proceed under any stage provided for under the provisions of this Article.\n\n1509. Awards involving application or enforcement of Article II (Subcontracting) shall not be enforced by strike action.\n\nSECTION XVI - TOOLS\n\n1600. The individual Employer shall provide on each jobsite a secure place where the employees may keep their tools.\n\n1601. Carpenters and apprentices shall furnish their own tools, but shall not furnish sawhorses, ladders, miter boxes, electric drills, power bits, power or battery tools and machines, electric cords, power saws or automotive equipment to be used for the purpose of hauling or delivering the Employer's materials or equipment. Each employee shall arrive on the jobsite with tools in a proper condition. If necessary, the employees shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time during the work week to sharpen their tools on the Employer's time. If the Employer so chooses, he may send out employee's saws to be sharpened by a commercial saw sharpener.\n\n1602. The Employer shall not contract with any workman or with any member of the family of a workman employed under this Agreement either by way of a lease, loan, or sale unless such member of the family is engaged in a bona fide licensed regular business regarding such tools.\n\n1603. If any individual employee's full box of working tools is lost by reason of fire, theft or forcible entry while in the individual Employer's care, the individual Employer shall reimburse the employee for such loss up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) within five (5) working days from the date of claim for loss of tools as provided herein, the individual Employer shall acknowledge liability therefore or reject the claim. To implement this section, the individual carpenter shall provide an exact written inventory of tools within five (5) days after starting the job.\n\nSECTION XVII - WORKING CONDITIONS\n\n1700.

The Employer shall provide a shelter for men to use at lunch time if no vehicle is available in the immediate locality of the project.\n\n1701. The Employer will carry adequate insurance for compensation of injured workmen. The Employer and all employees mutually recognize the need for the provision and maintenance of safe working conditions, the observance of proper safety practices with respect to the use of tools, equipment and supplies, and compliance with all applicable federal and state safety rules and\nregulations. Employees are required to report work injuries immediately to the Employer upon occurrence. Employees shall not be required to work under hazardous conditions when the performance of such work is in contravention to applicable Federal and State Safety Rules and Regulations. First aid kits must be provided and maintained on the jobsite.\n\n1702. The Employer will immediately notify the Union by telephone of any industrial accident involving an employee covered by this Agreement that is of a nature that is required to be reported to the State of Nevada under applicable State laws. Where an employee is required to work in a hazardous area where there is a mutually recognized hazard and exposure to possible injury, such employee shall not be required to work alone.\n\n1703. The Employer shall not refuse to hire for employment an applicant who is physically able to perform his work or discharge or discriminate against such an employee, because of any industrial injury incurred by the workman prior to employment or because of the filing of a claim for workers' compensation benefits.\n\n1704. Each employee employed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall receive the minimum hourly wage rates specified in this Agreement. Any other method of paying employees, such as the use of piecework, bonus systems, quota setting or lumping of the work, shall be deemed a violation of this Agreement. Work performed under this Agreement shall be done by the employees of the Employer on an hourly basis subject to the subcontracting provisions of this Agreement, and the Employer recognizes those sections of the Constitution and Bylaws of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America which prohibit its members from contracting for labor only. The contracting Employer agrees that all work covered by this Agreement shall be performed by carpenters and that such workmen shall be employees of the Employer or the subcontractor employed under the terms of this Agreement. The provisions regarding piecework and minimum hourly wage rates shall not be applicable in the event a carpenter is employed under Appendix \"D\" relating to residential construction.\n\n1705. An employee who as a result of an on-the-job industrial injury is unable to complete a full day's work shall be paid for the full day on which such injury occurred, provided, however, that such payment need not be paid where said injury does not require the attention of a physician who has certified the employee's inability to complete the work on that day because of such injury. If the employee is required to keep a doctor's appointment during working hours and such doctor's appointment is the direct result of an on-the-job industrial accident, then his pay will continue for the time he is absent from the job for such doctor's office visit provided he furnishes satisfactory proof to the Employer.\n\n1706. When any protective equipment or clothing is necessary, all such equipment or clothing shall be furnished by the Employer.\n\n1707. Employees shall not be discriminated against for failure to work behind a picket line sanctioned by the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters.\n\n1708. Neither the Employer nor the Union will discriminate against a person with respect to employment or Union membership because of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin or\nancestry. This provision shall apply to hiring, placement for employment, training during employment, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation and benefits, selection for training including apprenticeship, layoff or termination, and application for admission to Union membership.\n\n1709. The Union shall within six months create a database that will track all apprentices and journeymen and their certifications along with the expiration of their certifications. All journeymen and apprentices shall be trained in and receive certifications in safety, CPR, first aid, OSHA, scaffold training, and any other certification or requirement to meet City, State or Federal rules or laws.\n\n1710. The Union shall be responsible for creating and implementing the certification program by December 31, 2007. Thereafter, the Union shall monitor and make any required changes in the program. The Union will also develop a program for notifying employees when their certifications are up for renewal.\n\n1711. The Contractor shall provide or pay for parking facilities for employees where free parking is not available within three blocks of the job, or one-quarter (1/4) mile, whichever is less. When bussing of employees from a remote parking facility is used, the employee will travel in on his or her own time not to exceed thirty (30) minutes and must be returned to the parking area no later than thirty (30) minutes after quitting time or overtime will be assessed for the delay. If an employee is at the designated parking area thirty minutes before the start of work he or she will be considered to have started work on time regardless of when the bus arrives at the jobsite. Where payment is applicable, payment shall be made to the carpenter who turns in a parking check stub for reimbursement of actual cost. Such parking check stubs may be turned in weekly or on termination of employment, whichever occurs sooner.\n\n1712. The parties to this Agreement recognize and understand that it would be inconsistent with the industry custom and practice to prohibit individuals, under normal conditions, during the first half of the shift, a 15 minute unorganized break at his or her assigned work area. If an employee is scheduled to work ten (10) or more hours on any day, he will be given a second fifteen (15) minute, unorganized break at the place of work during the second half of the shift between the sixth and ninth hour.\n\nSECTION XVIII - UNION SECURITY\n\n1800. The following Union Shop clause shall become operative if and when a court of competent jurisdiction should decide that a Union Shop provision as provided herein is lawful within the State of Nevada:\n\n1801.

Membership in the appropriate Local Union shall be available upon terms and qualifications not more burdensome than those applicable at such times to other applicants for membership in the Union.\n\nSECTION XIX - SAVINGS CLAUSE\n\n1900. It is not the intent of either party hereto to violate any laws, rulings or regulations of any governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Agreement, and the parties agree that in the event that any provisions of this Agreement are finally held or determined to be illegal or void as being in contravention of any such laws, rulings, or regulations, nevertheless the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless the parts so found to be void are fully inseparable from the remaining portion of this Agreement. The parties agree that if and when any provisions of this Agreement are held or determined to be illegal or void, they will then promptly enter in lawful negotiations concerning the substance thereof.\n\nSECTION XX - FOREMEN\n\n2000. The selection of an individual who will be the carpenter foreman is at the sole discretion of the Employer. It is understood that a foreman shall be an employee employed under the terms of this Agreement and the dispatching and hiring provisions of Appendix \"A\", and shall receive the foreman's differential pay. Such foreman may work with the tools of the trade except as hereinafter provided. Whenever there are four or more journeyman employees, one must be designated as the foreman. When a carpenter is designated as a foreman and is assigned the responsibility of supervising ten (10) or more employees, he shall not be allowed to work as a journeyman except for the purpose of instruction or for incidental assistance to a journeyman or apprentice. In case more than two foremen are employed on the same shift on a single job, there shall be designated a general foreman. Any foreman who does not work, with his tools during regular working hours cannot work with his tools on overtime or on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. For this purpose a Foreman is described as a Journeyman who receives direction from a Superintendent or General Foreman to direct, supervise or instruct any group or crew of carpenters, with the knowledge that he or she is responsible for a segment of the project.\n\nSECTION XXI - SURETY BOND\n\n2100. Each employer signatory to, or bound by, this Agreement shall furnish a Fringe Benefit Payment Bond, letter of credit or similar security in such form as may be approved by the Board of Trustees of the various trust funds as follows:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES</th>\n    <th>FACE AMOUNT</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>0 - 5</td>\n    <td>$15,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>6 - 12</td>\n    <td>$25,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>13 - 25</td>\n    <td>$50,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>26 - 50</td>\n    <td>$100,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>51 - 75</td>\n    <td>$150,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>76 or more</td>\n    <td>$200,000.00</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n2101. Said Bonds (or other suitable security) shall be in favor of the currently designated Administrator (or whomever the Board of Trustees shall designate) of all the aforesaid Fringe Benefit Trust Funds referred to in this Agreement. In the event an Employer fails to furnish a Fringe Benefit Payment Bond (or other suitable security) within ten (10) days after requested, in accordance with the above procedure, the Union shall be relieved of all obligations under this Agreement insofar as concerns such Employer. In addition, in order to preserve its own interests and protect its members, immediately upon knowledge of any such event, the Union shall authorize and direct its members to refuse to work for such Employer. The Carpenters Trust Fund shall be directed to use reasonable efforts to collect delinquencies from bonds in addition to other sources of payments.\n\nSECTION XXII - EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION\n\n2200. This Agreement shall be effective as of July 1, 2007 and shall remain in full force and effect to and including June 30, 2011 and continue in full force and effect from year to year thereafter unless canceled or modified as herein provided. Either party to the Agreement may give written notice to the other of a desire to change, modify or terminate the Agreement at least sixty (60) days but not more than ninety (90) days prior to June 30, 2011 or June 30 of any succeeding year.\n\n2201. The Union agrees that in the event that either party should exercise its right under the first paragraph of this Section, the Union will for a period of sixty (60) days prior to June 30 of any such year, bargain with the Employer with respect to all wage rates, working conditions and hours of employment for this work herein covered, and the Employer agrees to bargain in the same manner. If no Agreement is entered into between the parties by July 1 of any year in which such notice shall be given, then this Agreement thereupon shall cease and terminate.\n\nDATE: July 12, 2007\nPAINTING & DECORATING CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA\n1701 WHITNEY MESA DR.,\nSUITE #104\nHENDERSON, NV 89014\n\nSIGNED BY: Thomas Pfundstein\nPRINTED NAME: Thomas Pfundstein\nTITLE: Executive Senior Director\n\nDATE: July 2, 2007\nSOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS AND AFFILIATED LOCAL UNIONS\n501 NORTH LAMB BLVD.\nLAS VEGAS, NV 89110\n\nSIGNED: Marc J.

The Local Unions shall establish and maintain open and nondiscriminatory employment on work covered by this Agreement.\n\n3002. It is agreed by the Employer and the Union to fully comply with all the provisions of the federal and state laws to the end that no person shall, on the grounds of sex, race, color, national origin, or membership or non-membership in a labor union, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the terms of this Agreement or otherwise subjected to discrimination by not having full access to the terms of this Agreement. The Union hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from any losses or damages resulting from any act or omission of the Union in breaching or failing to comply with all such laws and regulations, not however, including court costs and attorneys fees not authorized by the Union.\n\n3003. The Employer shall first call upon the Local Union having jurisdiction for such men as the Employer may from time to time need, and the respective Local Union shall furnish to the Employer the required number of qualified and competent workmen of the classification requested by the Employer strictly in accordance with the provision of this section.\n\n3004. It shall be the responsibility of the Employer when ordering men to give the Local Union all of the pertinent information regarding the workmen's employment, to enable the dispatch of the workmen required.\n\n3005. The Local Union will furnish, in accordance with the request of the individual Employer, such qualified and competent workmen of the classifications needed from among those entered on the employment lists, to the individual Employer by use of a written referral in the following order of preference on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based on or in any way affected by Union membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership policies or requirements. All applicants for referrals to jobs shall receive equal consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, creed, color or national origin, in conformity with the requirements of the federal and state laws.\n\n3006. The selection of qualified, competent workmen and the order of preference on dispatching of such workmen shall be on the following basis:\n\n3006.1 To qualify for referral as a journeyman, the applicant must submit evidence either of satisfactorily having completed a course in apprenticeship training conducted by or under the DIRECTION (discretion) of the standards of the Bureau of Apprenticeship, United States Department of Labor, or he shall submit satisfactory written proof that he has at least four (4) years experience in the carpenter trade.\n3006.2 The Union shall maintain a register of all applicants so qualified, established on the basis of the groups listed below, each applicant being registered in the highest priority group for which he qualifies:\n\n3007.

On jobs with no on site or in office hiring or solicitation one worker in four (4) must be requested off the top of the list.\n\n3010. The dispatcher at the Local Union in the first instance, in accordance with the provisions of this section, will determine whether a workman is qualified to register and into what group or list he shall be placed. This determination will normally be based upon information or papers which the workman or the Employer supplies. If any doubt exists as to any material matter, the dispatcher may call or otherwise make a prompt investigation to get any facts required.\n\n3011. The Local Union shall post at the hiring hall of the Local Union all Provisions, including the terms of this Agreement and any hiring hall procedures adopted by the Union and not in conflict with terms of the Agreement. Copies of such hiring hall procedures shall be posted in an area where notices to applicants for employment with the individual Employers are customarily posted.\n\n3012. When ordering workmen, the individual Employer will give written notice to the Local Union, if possible, no later than 2:30 p.m. of the day prior (Monday through Friday), or in any event not less than twelve (12) hours, if possible, before the reporting time. In the event forty-eight (48) hours elapse after such notice without the Local Union furnishing any workmen, (Saturdays, Sundays and recognized Holidays excluded) the individual employer may procure workmen from any other source or sources. If workmen are so employed, the individual Employer shall promptly report, to the appropriate Local Union, each such workman by name.\n\n3013. Subject to the terms of this Section, the individual Employer retains the right to reject any workman referred by the Union for any reason, and the individual Employer may discharge an employee for any cause which he may deem sufficient, provided, however, in the hiring or discharging there shall not be any discrimination or the part of the Employer against any employee for activities in behalf of or in representation of the Union not interfering with the proper performance of his duties. In the event the Employer does not hire the workman dispatched, the Employer shall pay such workman a minimum of two (2) hours show-up pay at the hourly rate and all fringe benefits for his classification in Zone 1 and a minimum of four (4) hours in Zone 2 & 3.\n\n3014. No show-up time will be applicable when a workman reports in a physically unfit condition to work or fails to report to the jobsite within one hour after being dispatched to a job located within twenty (20) miles from the Local Union Hall, or refuses to work when assigned by the\nEmployer, or reports to the job and fails to have the traditional tools of the trade necessary to perform the job. The provisions on not paying show-up time as set forth in this section shall also be applicable to the requirement of paying zone pay to an employee reporting to a zone beyond twenty (20) miles from the Las Vegas Area Free Zone as set forth in Section VIII of this Agreement.\n\n3015. When requesting an apprentice from the Union and such apprentice is not called by name, then the Union shall dispatch an apprentice from the hiring list in the order that the apprentice has signed the list, regardless of the year of such apprentice's training.

The parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the construction industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to maintain a drug and alcohol free work environment, individual employers may require applicants or employees to undergo drug testing. The parties agree that if a testing program is implemented by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and Management.\n\n7000.1 It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer's job premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed under the applicable agreement.\n\n7000.2 All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug test at the direction of the Employer, but not later than five (5) days after commencement of work, at a facility agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The cutoff levels for both the initial test and the confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The facility where the sample is tested will be approved by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Employer agrees to pay each applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug test for all the time it takes to undergo the drug test up to a maximum of two (2) hours travel time plus lab time. If an employee fails the drug test and has time coming to him or her, the employer may withhold the cost of the drug test from the final check. Employers may use an oral fluid test or urine screen, solely as a type of pre-employment screening process. Testing procedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the products' manufacturing specifications (\"Avtar ORAL screen\" or Branan Medical Corp. \"Oratec\"). Any \"non-negative\" test results shall be designated as inconclusive. Employers may seek a urine test at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing procedure set forth in this collective bargaining agreement to confirm results.\n\n7000.3 Applicants not passing the drug test will not be placed on the Employer's payroll or receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug test will be removed from the Employers payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug test.\n\n7000.4 The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one (1) of whom may be a Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.\n7000.5 An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be tested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the accident resulted from drug usage.\n\n7000.6 There will be no individual random drug testing by the signatory Employer.\n\n7000.7 It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of prescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.\n\n7000.8 A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and confirmation test. The initial test will be an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (E M I T). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test a confirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or applicant. The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G C/M S). The cutoff levels for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long term frozen storage for a minimum of one (1) year. Collection and transportation of each sample must be done in accordance with the procedures mandated by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n7000.9 Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a rehabilitation program at the employee's expense. When such program has been successfully completed, the Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work, for which the employee is qualified, exists, he or she shall be reinstated.\n\n7000.10 Any dispute which arises under this drug and alcohol policy shall be submitted to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.\n\n7000.11 In the event an individual Employer is required, as a condition of contract award, to abide by the terms and conditions of an owner's drug and alcohol policy, the Employer will notify the interested Unions in writing prior to implementing such policy.\n\n7000.12 The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an employee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.\n\n7000.13 The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's application of the Substance Abuse Program.\n7000.14 The Employers will be allowed to conduct periodic jobsite drug testing on construction projects until completion of work under the following circumstances:\n\n    7000.14.1 The entire jobsite must be tested including all employees of the Employer.\n\n    7000.14.2 Prior to start of periodic jobsite testing the Employer will notify the Union in writing.\n\n    7000.14.3 Analysis shall be conducted by a Federal Department of Health and Human Services certified lab.\nPAINTERS &
