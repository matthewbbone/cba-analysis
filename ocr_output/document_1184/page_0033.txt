concerning an individual contractor who fails or refuses to appear shall be made unless the neutral arbitrator issues said decision.

1502. The Joint Adjustment Board and the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have the power to adjust grievances and disputes, make awards of back pay, levy fines for violations of the Agreement, and assess liquidated damages in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, which shall be final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement. The Joint Adjustment Board may, as part of a remedy in any case before it, order an increase of the bonding requirements specified in this Agreement up to a maximum of $30,000.00, or an amount equivalent to the average of the three (3) highest contributing months within the previous twelve (12) month period, whichever is greater, and may specify the effective date of such bonding requirements.

1503. The parties recognize and acknowledge that compliance with the requirements to pay wages, fringe benefits, and to abide by the provisions of this Agreement is essential for maintenance of this Agreement, the health and safety of workers covered thereunder, the fairness to all parties (including the Union, employees and employers in the industry), and that it would be extremely difficult if not impracticable to fix the actual expense and damage to the workers, and the Union, and the industry, for any failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any liquidated damages assessed by the Joint Adjustment Board or the arbitrator shall become due and payable to the Joint Adjustment Board as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Neither the Joint Adjustment Board nor the impartial arbitrator shall have the authority to modify, vary, change, add to or remove any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

1504. In addition to any rules and procedures which the Panel may adopt, the Joint Adjustment Board and the permanent neutral arbitrator shall be governed by the following provisions:

1504.1 All proceedings shall be done in an expedited manner and no briefs, transcripts or written opinions shall be required unless specifically requested by any parties to the grievance or unless ordered by the permanent neutral arbitrator. The parties specifically agree that the permanent neutral arbitrator shall not be required to render an expanded opinion in any case unless requested prior to the commencement of the proceedings.

1504.2 The Board shall meet within forty-five (45) days of any item referred to it and shall establish regular monthly meetings for the purposes of hearing all grievances and claims filed therein. The Board shall provide notice of time and place of hearings to all persons having business before the Board and shall establish regular meeting places and mailing address for all matters. All proceedings of the Southern Nevada Joint Adjustment Board shall be held in the City of Las Vegas unless mutually agreed to move to another location.

1504.3 The expenses of the Joint Adjustment Board and the permanent neutral arbitrator, including all costs of a court reporter or otherwise, shall be paid by the Contract Administration Committee provided that all fines, assessments, or liquidated damages which are not awarded to individual employees or to the Trust Funds shall be retained by the Joint Adjustment Board to defray expenses.
