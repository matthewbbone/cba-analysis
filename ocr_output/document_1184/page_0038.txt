SECTION XX - FOREMEN

2000. The selection of an individual who will be the carpenter foreman is at the sole discretion of the Employer. It is understood that a foreman shall be an employee employed under the terms of this Agreement and the dispatching and hiring provisions of Appendix "A", and shall receive the foreman's differential pay. Such foreman may work with the tools of the trade except as hereinafter provided. Whenever there are four or more journeyman employees, one must be designated as the foreman. When a carpenter is designated as a foreman and is assigned the responsibility of supervising ten (10) or more employees, he shall not be allowed to work as a journeyman except for the purpose of instruction or for incidental assistance to a journeyman or apprentice. In case more than two foremen are employed on the same shift on a single job, there shall be designated a general foreman. Any foreman who does not work, with his tools during regular working hours cannot work with his tools on overtime or on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. For this purpose a Foreman is described as a Journeyman who receives direction from a Superintendent or General Foreman to direct, supervise or instruct any group or crew of carpenters, with the knowledge that he or she is responsible for a segment of the project.
