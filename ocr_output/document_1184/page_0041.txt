3010. The dispatcher at the Local Union in the first instance, in accordance with the provisions of this section, will determine whether a workman is qualified to register and into what group or list he shall be placed. This determination will normally be based upon information or papers which the workman or the Employer supplies. If any doubt exists as to any material matter, the dispatcher may call or otherwise make a prompt investigation to get any facts required.

3011. The Local Union shall post at the hiring hall of the Local Union all Provisions, including the terms of this Agreement and any hiring hall procedures adopted by the Union and not in conflict with terms of the Agreement.

In the event the Employer does not hire the workman dispatched, the Employer shall pay such workman a minimum of two (2) hours show-up pay at the hourly rate and all fringe benefits for his classification in Zone 1 and a minimum of four (4) hours in Zone 2 & 3.
