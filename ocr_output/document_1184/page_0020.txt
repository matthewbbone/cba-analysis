account of the employee. Prior to the deposit in the separate bank accounts of the Agent, on the one hand, and the Vacation Trust, on the other, the bank will separate the funds transmitted into dues and vacation contributions, respectively, based on whether or not a proper dues deduction authorization will have been filed. The bank will then deposit such sums in the account of either the Agent or the Vacation Trust. The Union will bear the responsibility for furnishing the written authorization referred to above. All costs incident to receipt, administration and remittance to the Union of the Supplemental Dues payment will be borne by the Union. This provision will not reduce the obligations of the Contractor to pay the full amount of vacation contributions specified in this Agreement. All written authorizations referred to above will be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of the execution and will renew automatically from year to year, unless the employee, by written notice served upon the Local Union and/or the Agent not more than twenty (20) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the first year or any year thereafter, will have revoked such authorization.
