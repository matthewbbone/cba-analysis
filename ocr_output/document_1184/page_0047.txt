APPENDIX "G" - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND DETECTION

7000. The parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the construction industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to maintain a drug and alcohol free work environment, individual employers may require applicants or employees to undergo drug testing. The parties agree that if a testing program is implemented by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and Management.

7000.1 It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer's job premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed under the applicable agreement.

7000.2 All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug test at the direction of the Employer, but not later than five (5) days after commencement of work, at a facility agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The cutoff levels for both the initial test and the confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The facility where the sample is tested will be approved by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Employer agrees to pay each applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug test for all the time it takes to undergo the drug test up to a maximum of two (2) hours travel time plus lab time. If an employee fails the drug test and has time coming to him or her, the employer may withhold the cost of the drug test from the final check. Employers may use an oral fluid test or urine screen, solely as a type of pre-employment screening process. Testing procedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the products' manufacturing specifications ("Avtar ORAL screen" or Branan Medical Corp. "Oratec"). Any "non-negative" test results shall be designated as inconclusive. Employers may seek a urine test at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing procedure set forth in this collective bargaining agreement to confirm results.

7000.3 Applicants not passing the drug test will not be placed on the Employer's payroll or receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug test will be removed from the Employers payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug test.

7000.4 The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one (1) of whom may be a Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.
