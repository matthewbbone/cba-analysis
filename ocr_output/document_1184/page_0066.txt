Section 9 All apprentices may change shops at least every six months in order to provide them with more rounded education of the trade. However, if an employer and his apprentice petition the J.A.T.C. With proof that said apprentice is receiving a proper training program, the J.A.T.C. May allow the apprentice to stay with the shop an additional six months. At the end of each six-month period an additional six months may be applied for. No apprentice will be engaged as a foreman or in any supervisory position.

Section 10 The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall have the right to take an apprentice from his employer if it is proven to the Committee that said apprentice is not benefiting from his job or is being misused.

All Apprentices shall be required to fill out and maintain in their possession an Employment activity book. A representative of the company shall sign this weekly. This is to insure that the education and training of the Apprentice continues. Upon evaluation of this record by the Apprenticeship Committee he may be removed from the employment with the contractor. It is the intention of this section not to cause loss of work but to insure that the apprentice is being trained in the craft.

Section 11 The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall be notified by the employer and the apprentice in writing of all hiring, releasing, and termination of apprentices.

Section 12 The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, shall be the governing body in all apprentice matters, however it is understood that the Painters and Decorators Joint Committee has jurisdiction over apprentice matters that are related to the administration of this Agreement.

APPRENTICE WAGES

Section 13 Apprentice wages shall be as follows:

Percentage of Journeymen wage rate

40% - 45% = 500 Hours Worked
45% - 50% = 1000 Hours Worked
50% - 55% = 1500 Hours Worked
55% - 65% = 2000 Hours Worked
65% - 75% = 3000 Hours Worked
75% - 85% = 4000 Hours Worked
85% - 95% = 5000 Hours Worked
95% -100% = 6000 Hours Worked
