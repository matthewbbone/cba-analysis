SECTION I - RECOGNITION

100. The Employer has satisfied itself that the Union represents a majority of Employees performing work covered by this Agreement and thereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of all employees of the Employers hereinafter classified over whom the Union has jurisdiction.

101. The Union recognizes the Employer as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for their respective members who have authorized the Employer to represent them. A list of such authorizations has been furnished to the Union and the Employer agrees to immediately notify the Union when any authorizations have been canceled or new authorizations have been executed.

102. The Agreement shall bind each and every Employer who has authorized the Association to represent them with the same force and effect as if the Agreement were entered in by each Member individually. The Employer shall be and continue to remain liable under this Agreement during the term irrespective of whether such members shall resign from the Association prior to the expiration date of this Agreement and such liability shall be deemed to have survived the termination of such membership and remain in force during the term of this Agreement.

103. The Employer, having received from the Union a demand or request for recognition as the majority representative of the unit employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement; and, having been presented with, or having been offered to be presented with, by the Union, proof that the union has the support of, or has received authorization to represent, a majority of the unit employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement; hereby expressly and unconditionally acknowledges and grants recognition to the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the unit employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement, pursuant to Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and agrees not to make any claim questioning or challenging the representative status of the Union.

Proof of such majority representation shall be established by the submission of authorization cards to a neutral third person who shall compare the signatures with appropriate employer records. The individual employer shall fully cooperate in such review upon demand by the Union or any of its affiliates. This paragraph does not apply to Employers' storage warehouse or yards.
