1400. A Union Representative, full-time, credentialed by the Regional Council, or steward shall have access to the job during working hours for the purpose of checking the manner in which the terms of this Agreement are being complied with. He shall make every reasonable effort to advise the individual Employer or his representatives of his presence on the job and shall not stop or interfere with the work of any workman without the permission of the individual Employer or his representative unless the Union Representative determines that there has been a violation of the Agreement by the Employer.
