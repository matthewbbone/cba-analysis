615. The failure to register jobs, and/or accurately report hours on jobs as required by this Agreement, shall entitle all of the Trusts to assess fringe benefits based upon the reports of the CAC field personnel as to their estimate of the hours that should have been paid on the particular job or jobs. Such estimate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount due and owing unless the estimate is found by the Joint Adjustment Board and/or the arbitrator to be arbitrary and capricious.

All payments required to be made by each Employer to the Vacation Savings Plan, the Health and Insurance Trust Fund, Grievance and Arbitration Administration Trust Fund, Carpenters Contractors Cooperation Committee, Contract Administration Trust, the Carpenters International Training Fund, the Pension Trust Fund, the Joint Apprenticeship Committee and the Journeyman Upgrading Fund, when applicable, under this Section shall be due and payable to the appropriate trust fund and Joint Apprenticeship Committee no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month for all hours worked by employees covered by this Agreement during the preceding month. An Employer who has not made such payments by the twentieth (20th) day of the month shall be considered in violation of the Agreement and a delinquent Employer. The grievance and arbitration procedure contained in Section XV shall not apply to any cases involving the failure of a contractor to pay fringe benefits as required herein. The Union shall take appropriate action against the Employer or Subcontractor who is delinquent in the payment of fringe benefit contributions under this Agreement, up to and including the withholding of manpower.

A list of Subcontractors or others who are delinquent in payment of fringe benefit contributions under this Agreement will be provided monthly to Employers and Employer Associations representing Employers, as close as reasonably possibly to the first of the next month succeeding the due date of reports referenced above.
