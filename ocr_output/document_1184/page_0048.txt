7000.5 An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be tested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the accident resulted from drug usage.

7000.6 There will be no individual random drug testing by the signatory Employer.

7000.7 It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of prescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.

7000.8 A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and confirmation test. The initial test will be an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (E M I T).

The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G C/M S). The cutoff levels for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long term frozen storage for a minimum of one (1) year. Collection and transportation of each sample must be done in accordance with the procedures mandated by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.

7000.9 Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a rehabilitation program at the employee's expense. When such program has been successfully completed, the Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work, for which the employee is qualified, exists, he or she shall be reinstated.

7000.12 The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an employee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.

7000.13 The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's application of the Substance Abuse Program.
