worked on the fifth (5th) or sixth (6th) day shall be paid at one and one half (1 \( \frac{1}{2} \)) the straight time rate all other hours at double (2X) the straight time rate.

Section 5 In the event that a majority of a shift is worked outside of the established day shift hours for any reason, the workweek and hours per shift shall be consistent with that of a normal day shift and shall be inclusive of a meal period (employee is paid 8 hours for 7 \( \frac{1}{2} \) hours worked) and the pay shall be at the straight time rate. This applies to shifts worked Monday through Friday only. Hours worked on Saturday and Sunday shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate.

Section 6 Employees shall be entitled to no less than an eight (8) hour rest period between shifts. Should the Employer fail to allow an eight hour rest period, the employee shall be treated as if they wee working on a continuation of the previous shift and shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate.

Section 7 Hours worked on Sunday and recognized holidays shall be paid at the rate of two times (2X) the straight time hourly rate.

Section 8 The contractor must register such starting time with the Joint Committee and Local Union, setting forth the hours that he chooses to work and once such decision is made, such hours would apply on each and every job being performed by said contractor. It has never been the intention of this section to allow the employer to start the project and then transfer employees to another job site since this could be in violation of overtime as provided for in this agreement.

Section 9 Any work beginning after 9:00 pm Sunday that ends on Monday shall be considered Monday work. This shall apply only if the shift hours worked for the week are consistant with the hours worked on Sunday. Any hours worked prior to 9:00 pm Sunday would be considered Sunday work and shall be paid at two times (2x) the regular straight time rate of pay.

Section 10 In recognition of the fact that the scope of work as defined in this agreement is increasingly more tourist oriented in the Las Vegas and Laughlin area, the parties have agreed to special work hours for Hotel Guest Room remodel type work. To cover specific job requirements such as rooms that must be ready for occupancy on Fridays, the agreement is as follows:

When the working schedule requires remodeling of guest rooms be started on Monday and be completed so they may be occupied on Friday and provided the Union is advised and agrees prior to the start of such project, the employer, may work a shift consisting of four (4) consecutive days Monday through Thursday and may work a shift of ten (10) hours at the straight time hourly rate.
