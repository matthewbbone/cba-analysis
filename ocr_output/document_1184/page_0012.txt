be given at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of work and shall contain all the information required by the Contract Administration Committee. On jobs where the time factor does not permit registration of jobs prior to their commencement, the Contractor shall notify the Union by telephone or fax giving all pertinent information regarding that specific job. Such notification must be confirmed in writing on the regular Job Registration Form by the Contractor to the Contract Administration Committee within 48 hours thereafter. The Union may withhold or withdraw workers from the Contractor for failure to comply with this Section 1.

301.2 In the event an employer takes over the performance of the contract covered by the terms of this Agreement for another employer, the successor employer shall notify the Contract Administration Committee by certified mail of its intent to undertake performance of the contract. Such notice shall be given prior to commencing work. Failure to give such notice shall subject the successor contractor to claims for any delinquent fringe benefits of the predecessor contractor through the grievance procedure in addition to any other claims which may arise because of such failure.

302. To the extent required by state law, the Employer shall be financially responsible for all wages and fringe benefit payments owed to any workmen or any funds established by this Agreement by the Employer's Subcontractor, or the Subcontractor of a Subcontractor, to any workmen or any Fund contributions required in this Agreement for work performed on the Employer's job or project, provided there has been an appropriate demand made in writing to recover said wages and fringe benefits. If the Employer has included the delinquent Subcontractor on a duly filed Job Registration Form, a copy of such demand will be furnished to the Employer. If the state law is amended to relieve the Employer of such responsibility, then this Section shall continue to be applicable on the Employer's responsibility to the extent of any monies remaining due from the Employer to the Subcontractor who is liable for wages or fringe benefit contributions.

303. Prior to implementation of this paragraph, the Union or Trust Fund will make a good faith effort to promptly notify the Employer of any and all delinquencies of the Subcontractor and make a good faith effort to exhaust execution of the Subcontractor's bond or bonds.

304. The terms and conditions of this Agreement insofar as it affects the individual Employer shall apply to any subcontractor under the control of or working under contract with the individual Employer upon work covered by this Agreement, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered as the individual Employer. Any subcontractor performing work under the jurisdiction of this Agreement must furnish all materials and equipment for the fabrication and/or installation thereof (except carpenter hand tools) and must compensate carpenters at the wage rates, fringe benefits and working conditions as specified in this Agreement.

305. For purposes of this Agreement, a subcontractor is any person (other than an employee covered by this Agreement), firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity that holds a valid State Contractor's License, wherever required by law, and who agrees under contract in writing with the Employer or in writing with his subcontractors to perform any work covered by this Agreement and who employs workmen as employees to perform services
