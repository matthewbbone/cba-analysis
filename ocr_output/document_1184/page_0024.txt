Contractor shall be required to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by such failure in addition to any other relief which may be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

614.4 In addition the Regional Council shall have the right to withdraw employees and refuse to dispatch workers to any individual Contractor who refuses audit entry within seven (7) calendar days or who refuses to make available relevant records necessary for the completion of the audit.

614.5 The CAC shall submit evidence of any alleged violation of this Agreement to the Association and the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, and shall then submit the matter to the Joint Adjustment Board for adjudication as though the complaint or grievance were filed by a Local Union, an individual Contractor or an individual worker.

614.6 In case the auditors designated by the Board of Trustees conduct an audit and determine that a Contractor has violated the provisions of this Agreement for hours worked (or paid for) in that the gross compensation, including any remuneration or compensation not required or permitted by this Agreement, divided by hours reported, exceeds the employee's base rate plus One Dollar ($1.00) per hour, or if adequate records are not made available to allow the auditor to make his determination in that regard, or if hours worked for each payroll period are not recorded on payroll records, then the auditors shall calculate or estimate gross compensation including any remuneration or compensation not permitted in this Agreement from whatever information is available. This amount determined to be the gross compensation, when divided by the appropriate hourly wage, exclusive of vacation and other fringe benefits, and then multiplied by the appropriate hourly fringe benefit contribution rate according to this Agreement, shall be considered due the respective Trust Funds.

614.7 The failure to register jobs as required by Article III of this Agreement and/or the failure to report accurately all hours worked in a given period to the respective Trust Funds and/or to pay fully the required amounts to said Trust Funds as required by Article V of this Agreement shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to violate this Agreement and shall require the auditors to apply the above-stated formula to determine the amount due the respective Trust Funds. The amount determined to be due by the application of the above formula shall be paid by the individual Contractor to the respective Trust Funds, unless challenged through the grievance procedure within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the demand for payment.

614.8 If the Contractor fails to pay the said amount, and if a grievance is filed, the Joint Adjustment Board or arbitrator shall be authorized to assess damages in addition to any other remedies deemed appropriate by the Joint Adjustment Board or the arbitrator.
