1. During the term of this Agreement, neither Party shall order or permit any lockout, strike or other work stoppage or slowdown. Further, the Union will not aid, support or permit unauthorized strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages by its members.

2. Grievance Procedure: All grievances or disputes involving any controversy, dispute or misunderstanding arising as to the meaning, application or observance of any provisions of this Agreement shall be handled in the manner hereinafter set forth.

Step 1. All grievances must be made known in writing to the other party within seven (7) working days after the reason for such grievance has occurred. An authorized representative of the
Union shall first submit a written grievance to the Job Superintendent, or his duly authorized representative. The authorized representative of the Union of the Employee or Employees involved shall be present at any meeting between the Job Superintendent and such employee or employees. The Job Superintendent or his duly authorized representative must make a written disposition of the matter within forty-eight (48) hours after the submission of such written grievance thereto.

Step 2. If the disposition of the matter by the Job Superintendent or his duly authorized representative is not satisfactory, the matter must be taken up by the Business Agent, and representative of the Employer with authority to act within forty-eight (48) hours of the written disposition set forth in Step 1.

Step 3. If the disposition of the matter in Step 2 is not satisfactory, the Business Manager shall attempt to resolve the matter with the President and C.E.O., AGC within forty-eight (48) hours after Step 2.

3. Arbitration: If Step 3 is not successful, the grievant shall request a list of seven (7) arbitrators from any one of the following sources: (1) the panel of arbitrators of the New York Board of Mediation; (2) the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or (3) the labor panel of the American Arbitration Association for final and binding decision. Such request shall be no later than seventy-two (72) hours after Step 3. Both parties agree to submit to such arbitration and be bound by and follow the decision rendered. Failure to do so on the part of

The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, modify, detract from, or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement or any amendment or supplement thereto. If the arbitrator should determine that the grievance is not covered by this Agreement, he shall return the grievance to the parties without decision and the grievance shall be closed. In such a case, the costs, if any, shall be borne by the grievant.

4. Violations concerning wages, hours, and all fringe benefit payments shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. In such cases, the Union shall give three (3) working days notice to the Employer that the Union will withdraw its men from the Employer's service. If the Employer contends there is a question of fact regarding the alleged violation, he may file for arbitration within the aforesaid three (3) working days. When a request for arbitration has been initiated, there shall be no work stoppage pending resolution of the dispute pursuant to this Article. Work jurisdiction, that is, disputes with respect to whether one group of employees or another group of employees shall perform certain work on the project is expressly not arbitrable under this contract.

tention is rejected by the arbitrator, and by the Union in case its principal contention is rejected by the arbitrator, except, however, that each party shall pay all of the fees of its own representatives and witnesses. Any dispute as to whose principal contention is rejected shall be determined by the arbitrator. In the case that both parties' principal contention is upheld in part, the arbitrator shall designate what part of the costs are to be borne by which party according to the relative merits of each party's position.
