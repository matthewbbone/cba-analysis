the Association, the Employer shall be liable for not only the amount of contributions due, but in addition thereto, any such employer agrees to pay interest, costs and fees of collection, legal fees not in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the amount of said delinquency and the costs of an audit if auditing procedures are necessary to ascertain the amount of the delinquencies. The failure of any employer to make timely and proper contributions and remittances to the Funds shall not relieve any other employer from making such payments.

3. It is further agreed between the parties hereto that in addition to the provision contained in the preceding paragraph, the Union is granted the unequivocal right, with respect to any delinquent employer, to declare this Agreement breached and at the option of the Union said Agreement may be considered terminated upon seventy-two (72) hours notice to any such delinquent employer. In the event that the Unions exercise such option under this section, such delinquent employer agrees to pay as liquidated damages, each of said employer's employees in the collective bargaining unit of the Unions, their regular rate of pay for all time lost from work as a result of the Employer's delinquency to the above listed Funds.

4. The parties hereto recognize that the Unions, the Funds, and/or any affiliated Fund may make contributions to the respective Funds for and on behalf of their employees. Such contribution shall be in the same amount and payable in the same manner as are made by other contributing employers.
