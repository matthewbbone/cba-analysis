12. It is mutually agreed and understood by the union and employers signatory to this Agreement, that in the event any Project Labor Agreements are effected within the jurisdictional area of this Agreement during its term, then those employers who are signatory to this Agreement and perform work under any such Project Labor Agreement shall be allowed to do so under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
