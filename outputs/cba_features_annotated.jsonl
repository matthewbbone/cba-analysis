{"document_id": "document_1_page_0086", "text": "agree. Nonparticipating Physicians' charges will be administered as stated in paragraph A. above.\n\nIII. INCREASE OR DECREASES IN COVERAGE\n\nWhen a change occurs in the regular job of an employee and such change results in the employee's regular job rate coming within a higher or lower hourly job rate bracket as set forth in the Table of Hourly Job Rate Brackets of this Exhibit B, the new corresponding coverages will be effective as follows:\n\nA. When an employee is permanently changed from one job to another, the new corresponding coverages will be effective as of the date the change is made. If an employee is permanently changed from one job to another, and such change results in the employee's new job rate coming within a lower Hourly Job Rate Bracket in the Schedule 1 table, the employee will retain the amount of Group Term Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage provided by the Hourly Job Rate Bracket corresponding to the rate of the job the employee previously held. In such event, the employee's Sickness and Accident Coverage nevertheless will be that provided by the Hourly Job Rate Bracket corresponding to the rate of the job to which the employee is changed.\n\nB. Temporary changes from one job to another will not affect the employee's coverages. Provided, however, when an increase in job rate occurs as a result of a change from one job to another on a temporary basis, the new corresponding coverages will be effective immediately. When the employee returns to his/her regular job rate, the corresponding coverages for that rate will be effective immediately.\n\nC. When a change in job rate occurs as a result of collective bargaining, the new corresponding coverages will be effective as of the date the change in job rate becomes effective.\n\nD. When an increase in job rate occurs as a result of the Job Analysis Program, the new corresponding coverages will be effective as of the date the rate adjustment becomes effective.
